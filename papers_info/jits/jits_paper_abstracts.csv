15472450903385999,"This article tackles the problem of a vehicle's geolocalization in urban areas. For this purpose, Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is the main sensor. However, the use of GPS alone is not sufficient in many urban environments. GPS has to be helped with dead-reckoned sensors, map data, and cameras. A novel observation of the absolute pose of the vehicle is proposed to back up GPS and the drift of dead-reckoned sensors. This approach uses a new source of information that is a geographical 3-dimensional (3D) model of the environment in which the vehicle navigates. This virtual 3D city model is managed in real time by a 3D geographical information system (3D GIS). This pose's observation is constructed by matching the virtual image provided by the 3D GIS and the real image acquired by an onboard camera. An extended Kalman filter combines the sensors measurements to produce an estimation of the vehicle's pose. Experimental results using data from an odometer, a gyroscope, a GPS receiver, a camera, and an accurate geographical 3D model of the environment illustrate the developed approach."
15472450903386005,"Understanding road features such as position and color of lane markings in a live video captured from a moving vehicle is essential in building video-based car navigation systems. In this article, the authors present a framework to detect road features in 2 difficult situations: (a) ambiguous road surface conditions (i.e., damaged roads and occluded lane markings caused by the presence of other vehicles on the road) and (b) poor illumination conditions (e.g., backlight, during sunset). Furthermore, to understand the lane number that a driver is driving on, the authors present a Bayesian network (BN) model, which is necessary to support more sophisticated navigation services for drivers such as recommending lane change at an appropriate time before turning left or right at the next intersection. In the proposed BN approach, evidence from (1) a computer vision engine (e.g., lane-color detection) and (2) a navigation database (e.g., the total number of lanes) was fused to more accurately decide the lane number. Extensive simulation results indicated that the proposed methods are both robust and effective in detecting road features for a video-based car navigation system."
15472450903386013,"Map-matching, which reconciles a vehicle's location with the underlying road map, is a fundamental function of a land vehicle navigation system. This article presents an improved Kalman filter approach whose state-space model is different from the conventional ones. The main objective of the research is to develop and apply a proper Kalman filter–based model for effectively correcting Global Positioning System (GPS) errors in map-matching. Based on the in-depth investigation of the characteristics of GPS errors, the authors presents a novel approach to update the state vector and other related parameters of the Kalman filter using both the historical tracks and road map information. The performance of the proposed approach is thoroughly examined by sample applications with real field data. The result shows that it handles the biased error and the random error of the GPS signals reasonably well in both the along-road and cross-road directions."
15472451003719699,"Travel time for an itinerary constitutes one of the most relevant roadway traffic metrics. Numerous studies have been conducted to estimate travel times on the basis of data from loop detectors. This article focuses on evaluating the performance of a set of estimation methods—algorithms that estimate route travel times using specific speed data from dual loop detectors for real-time applications, such as displaying travel times on changeable message signs. The travel-time estimates are evaluated against probe vehicle data obtained from FasTrak in the San Francisco Bay Area to determine the accuracy of the estimates. The study reveals that (a) the dispersion of travel time is often larger in off-peak periods than in peak periods for heavily congested freeways; (b) assessed against the same set of speed data, the evaluated algorithms have similar performance; (c) the accuracy of travel-time estimates on the basis of loop-detector data is better in off-peak periods than in peak periods; (d) lane-by-lane speeds from loop detectors may be used to improve travel time estimation; and (e) travel time estimation quality is more sensitive to actual sensor locations if sensors are sparse."
15472451003719715,"This article is concerned with a mathematical generalization of macroscopic road network mobility model, the cell transmission model. The objective is to enhance the conventional single-class cell transmission model (S-CTM) to a more generalized multiclass cell transmission model (M-CTM). This latter model can take into account the mixed composition of vehicle classes (i.e., with distinct free-flow speed and vehicle length). The aim is to introduce head-of-cell and end-of-cell vehicles into the model. Cascading, merging, and diverging scenarios of cells for M-CTM have been formulated so that the model can be applied to a general topology of road network. Experimental results are provided to compare S-CTM and M-CTM in 6 network test cases with the microscopic simulator—MITSIM—and to actual measurement of network traffic conditions. The results suggest that M-CTM is significantly more accurate than S-CTM in the tested networks with nonstationary vehicle composition, with platoon dispersions and with time-varying jam status. In addition, accuracy improvement of M-CTM is obtained without compromising the computational complexity. It is therefore expected that the proposed M-CTM would be well applicable in practice."
15472451003719723,"Probe vehicles represent samples in a traffic stream, and hence, probe-based traffic monitoring relies on effective sampling of vehicles. Current research views sampling from a networkwide perspective, and a single sample size is specified for the entire network. Using this method, research has indicated that the smaller routes in a network, such as minor and other arterials, are not adequately monitored. Increasing the sample size is not always a feasible option because of the restrictions of cost for use of the wireless network bandwidth and the availability of required number of probe vehicles. In this article, the authors describe a research effort that identified and extended stratified sampling as a method for increasing the efficacy of probe-based traffic monitoring. A methodology for application of stratified sampling for probe-based traffic monitoring is developed and implemented using a heavily traveled suburban traffic network simulation as a case study. Also, the authors discuss results of the implementation and the future direction of research."
15472451003719756,"The authors propose a real-time adaptive signal control model that aims to maintain the adaptive functionality of actuated controllers while improving the performance of traffic-actuated control systems. In this model, a flow-prediction algorithm is formulated to estimate the future vehicle arrival flow for each signal phase at the target intersection on the basis of the available signal-timing data obtained from previous control cycles. Optimal timing parameters are determined on the basis of these estimations and are used as signal-timing data for further optimizations. To be consistent with the operation logic of existing signal-control devices, this model is developed to optimize the basic control parameters that can be found in modern actuated controllers. Microscopic simulation is used to test and evaluate the proposed control model in a calibrated network consisting of 38 actuated signals. Simulation results indicate that this model has the potential to improve the performance of the signalized network under different traffic conditions."
15472451003719764,"Usually, benefits from deploying an adaptive traffic control system are measured by comparing data collected in the field before the system is installed with those collected after the system is fully operational. Such an approach is costly because it requires installation of a system before potential benefits can be observed. Nowadays to investigate effectiveness of many alternatives that were traditionally investigated in field, microsimulation is used. However, how much can one rely on results from microsimulation? There has not been a single study in which benefits of adaptive traffic control systems measured in the field are compared with those obtained through microsimulation. This study presents such a research effort. The authors compared performance measures from a field evaluation of Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System in Park City, Utah, to their counterparts from microsimulation. They collected a significant amount of data to assess system performance in the field and to help build a microsimulation model. A 14-intersection model of the Park City network was developed, calibrated, and validated on the basis of multiple data sources. The results show that a validated microsimulation model can accurately reflect field conditions although such an effort can be very challenging."
15472450.2010.484740,"In transportation planning, there can be long lead times to adapt capacity. This article addresses two questions. First, in a one mode world (e.g., rail or road), what is the optimal capacity choice when faced with uncertain demand, long lead times, and congestion. Using a simple analytical model, it is shown that when demand is inelastic, it is socially optimal to invest more than if only the expected level of demand is taken into account. In this case, it may be beneficial to overinvest in capacity because congestion costs are an increasing function of relative use. This result holds with or without optimal tolling. The second question deals with 2 competing modes in which only one mode has long lead times for capacity, whereas the other has flexible capacity. This is typical for the competition between high-speed rail and air for the medium distance trips (500–1,000 km), or for the competition between inland waterways and trucks for freight. We find that overinvestment is less justified because the substitute mode can more easily absorb the high-demand outcomes."
15472450.2010.484742,"The authors conducted an experimental study about road haulers' choice between railways and roads. If road haulers choose to load their truck on a train, they are not able to switch to using the road again until they reach the end of the line. On the contrary, highway choice is flexible in that the road hauler can change road at any time. Building upon the irreversibility of one of the two choices, the authors build a model in which traffic levels are risky using both infrastructures. In the model, they found that haulers' choices depend on the infrastructure price for railways and on the information level obtained by the hauler during travel. The flexible option is more valuable the more informed the agent is about traffic levels. These theoretical predictions are tested by implementing two experimental treatments. In the first, agents gain no information during their travel; in the second they become perfectly informed about traffic conditions during the travel. It is important that experimental payoffs are calibrated upon transport data about time and operating costs and infrastructure tariffs in France. From the experiment, the authors found that more risk-averse agents assign more value to the flexible option. The second result is that participants overreact to infrastructure price changes. The results indicate that, as the model stands, price levels and information level are important explanatory variables of choice. The higher the price is for railways and the higher the information is, the more participants give value to flexible option (highway), especially if participants are risk averse. The second result is that participants overreact to infrastructure price modification. The authors observed that, except for low levels of price, participants tend to choose the flexible option more frequently, even if it is suboptimal."
15472450.2010.484746,"This article presents a formulation of information acquisition that uses search theory to evaluate the value of information. The value of information is the added utility from being able to choose from the available travel alternatives after having received the information. There are three main advantages to the formulation: first, it results in a parsimonious model of information acquisition and travel choice. Second, it enables the use of observed information acquisition behavior for the estimation of travel related parameters (e.g., value of time). Third, its parameters are easily interpretable. The formulation is tested using data from a multimodal travel simulator with information provision. Estimation results provide face validity to the formulation. Results indicate that travelers on non–business trips attach particular importance to mean travel times, whereas during business trips travel time variability also plays an important role. Also, it is found that travelers prefer information that adds previously unknown alternatives to their choice set over information that provides estimates for uncertain attributes of known alternatives. A substantial heterogeneity exists with respect to travelers' valuation of the costs and benefits of travel information."
15472450.2010.484749,"This article develops a disaggregate discret-choice model for risky travel alternatives, considering travel time as a random variable. The theory of rank-dependent expected utility is used to describe traveler behavior. It disentangles attitude toward risk of travel time loss (perception of time distributions) from attitude toward wealth (perception of time outcomes). The key assumption is that decision makers formulate their own beliefs on probability distributions whenever information is public knowledge. The concept of travel-time reliability premium is then defined. It generalizes the notion of value of travel time savings by proposing a measure of the willingness-to-pay to get another time distribution. An application to air route choice is demonstrated by using a sample of regular business passengers who belong to an airline loyalty program. The empirical approach relies on estimating a Box-Cox Logit model."
15472450.2010.484751,"Understanding how reliability is valued is important because it provides insight into how aims of policies that aspire to provide better transport options can be more fully integrated with user expectations. Better reliability is a desired outcome of transportation policies because it reduces scheduling costs. This study uses a stated preference survey to collect route preference data, in which each route is described by the travel time experience on it. Because travel-time decisions are made from momentary recollections of past experience, the paradigm adopted in this study is that the mode travel time rather than the mean is the important basis for travel time decisions. The authors then explore three alternate measures of reliability and use them to estimate route choice models on the basis of the stated preference data. Two of the measures, range coupled with lateness probability and standard deviation, have been explored before. A third measure based on time moment (moments of inertia) measured from the mode travel time is also proposed and tested. Each measure reveals something different about how people value different aspects of reliability. In all cases, reliability is valued highly, although differently depending on how it is defined. The values of reliability and travel time highlight that transportation policy makers can provide significant benefits to users from strategies that seek to increase reliability."
15472450.2010.484753,"In this article, the authors propose an efficient algorithm for finding a risk-averse path for use in autonomous vehicle navigation systems. When no dynamic traffic information is available, a risk-averse path can be found by a constrained A* search. The accuracy of navigation on the basis of static network data is improved by taking travel-time uncertainty into account. When dynamic traffic information in the form of broadcast traffic messages is available, rerouting is achieved by a constrained A* search, which takes congestion propagation into account. By making use of information computed at the start of the trip, the authors propose a responsive version of the constrained A* search, which reduces the on-demand response time. An experimental performance analysis of the proposed methods on grid graphs demonstrates their efficiency."
15472450.2010.516226,"This article presents the results of a microscopic traffic simulation study conducted to investigate the impact of a Congestion Assistant on traffic efficiency and traffic safety. The Congestion Assistant is an in-vehicle system in which an active pedal supports the driver when approaching congestion and a stop-and-go function when driving in congestion. The authors used an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Modeller traffic flow simulation tool to study the effect of the Congestion Assistantin congestion caused by a lane drop. This article describes (a) how the Congestion Assistant operates and (b) the main features of the ITS Modeller. Furthermore, it examines the calibration and validation of the ITS Modeller for congestion caused by a lane drop using traffic flow measurements on a segment of the Dutch A12 highway. Simulation experiments of different penetration rates and system settings show that the stop and go leads to a 30% decrease in travel-time delay at a 10% penetration rate, while the active pedal leads to small reductions in travel-time delay. Compared with the stop-and-go function, the active pedal has fewer sharp accelerations and decelerations, which implies better traffic safety and driver comfort. The effect of the stop-and-go active pedal combination is similar to that of the stop-and-go function on its own. The authors further discuss the implications of the results."
15472450.2010.516229,"One popular intelligent transportation systems (ITS) element that has been deployed in various areas of the United States is variable-message signs (VMSs). Such signs are part of advanced traveler information systems, and they can help drivers make better en route decisions regarding their trips. Unlike most other ITS elements (e.g., ramp metering, advanced signals), VMSs are not supported by mandatory regulations. Consequently, the expected benefit from implementing VMSs largely depends on the response of drivers. This study explored the factors affecting alternative route choices of car drivers with VMSs on the interstate highway system. This study adopted a method called LOTUS to analyze driver-compliance behavior with VMSs. Driver behavior under information provision through VMS data has been collected using the stated-preference approach. The study showed that travel-time saving is not the single dominant factor for driver route choice under information provision. This article explores variables that are associated with driver compliance."
15472450.2010.516232,"This article formulates an improved integer-programming model to assign multiple types of emergency response service units among their candidate base stations to maximize the coverage to the critical infrastructures, subject to station capacity, service time, and reliability constraints. Unlike past models, this new model formulation accounts for the fluctuation of travel time and demand frequency at different time periods of a day. The potential applications of the model have been illustrated via a case study of assigning firefighting units and ambulances in the city of El Paso, Texas. This article also demonstrates how the model can be modified for the selection of a new base station, increase in fleet size, station capacity expansion, or a combination of these."
15472450.2010.517477,"The estimation of path or trip travel-time reliability is critical to any advanced traveler information system. The state-of-practice procedures for estimating path travel-time reliability assume that travel times follow a normal distribution and that segment travel times are independent (i.e., trip variance is a summation of segment variances). The present study analyzes Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) data from San Antonio, Texas, and simulated data to demonstrate through goodness-of-fit tests that a log-normal travel-time distribution is valid only under steady-state conditions, whereas a normal distribution is not valid. In the present article, the authors propose five methods for the estimation of path travel-time variance from its component segment travel-time variances. The analysis demonstrates that computing the trip travel-time coefficient of variation as the conditional expectation over all realizations of roadway segments provides estimates within 70% of trip travel-time variance for both uncongested and congested conditions."
15472450.2011.544571,"Vehicle reidentification methods can be used to anonymously match vehicles crossing 2 different locations on the basis of vehicle attribute data. In this article, reidentification methods are developed to match commercial vehicles that cross 2 weigh-in-motion sites in Oregon that are separated by 145 miles. Using vehicle length and axle data as attributes to characterize vehicles, a Bayesian model is developed that uses probability density functions obtained by fitting Gaussian mixture models to a sample data set of matched vehicles. The reidentification model when applied to a test data set (where each downstream vehicle also crosses the upstream site) matches vehicles with an accuracy of 91% when both axle weight and axle spacings data are used. To account for the fact that not all vehicles in the downstream also cross the upstream site, an additional new step is developed to screen mismatched vehicles produced by the algorithm. For this step, several screening methods are developed that allow the user to trade off the total number of matched vehicles and error rate. For evaluating the effectiveness of the screening methods, 2 scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, only common vehicles that cross both the upstream and downstream sites are considered, whereas in the second scenario all downstream vehicles are considered. It is shown that the mismatch error can be reduced to as low as 1% and 5% at the expense of not matching about 25% of the common vehicles (crossing both sites) for the first and second scenarios, respectively."
15472450.2011.544576,"Travel demand estimation is a complicated process because it is highly influenced by human perceptions and behaviors embedded in travelers’ decision making. In addition, some variables in travel demand estimation models have inexact values, especially the ones that are required for future estimation of travel demand. This article offers and applies an expert-guided algorithm to incorporate expert knowledge into Adaptive Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for handling travel demand estimation uncertainties. ANFIS is an appropriate hybrid intelligent system combining fuzzy logic and neural networks. The ANFIS rule base structure facilitates integration of qualitative knowledge acquired from experts and quantitative information from observational data. An expert-guided algorithm in conjunction with ANFIS, called expert-guided ANFIS (EGANFIS), is presented to compensate data insufficiency caused by uncertainties. The EGANFIS is applied to a real-world problem for estimating trip production, attraction, distribution, and modal split in Shiraz, a large city in Iran. The comparison of results with traditional models and ANFIS shows that EGANFIS increases performance of travel demand estimation models in terms of learning and indicates that the model is accurate enough to provide meaningful information and to enable generalization of the findings. Furthermore, rule base structure of EGANFIS enhances its interpretability in comparison with traditional models."
15472450.2011.544584,"The authors present a framework for a geographic information systems (GIS)–based decision support system (DSS) designed to provide online routing instructions in response to updated information on traffic and weather conditions for vehicles transporting hazardous materials. Embedded within the DSS is a heuristic that exploits a spatially and temporally rolling horizon. The heuristic is implemented using standard, widely available tools to facilitate adoption by decision makers. The DSS's ability to dynamically update instructions in response to real-time information is demonstrated along the corridor between the metropolitan areas of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland."
15472450.2011.544587,"Vision-based lane departure warning systems (LDWS) use images collected by small cameras to track the pavement markings and warn drivers when their vehicles perform unintended drifts out of the travel lanes. Pavement marking visibility at night is a function of the marking's retroreflectivity. During rain, pavement markings are covered by water, reducing the retroreflectivity and adversely affecting the visibility of the markings at night. This study examines the effects of the marking's retroreflectivity on the performance of LDWS, based on tests conducted in the field and in a simulated rain facility. The results indicate that improving the retroreflectivity attributes of commonly used pavement marking materials such as thermoplastic and paints improves the performance of LDWS for rain conditions at night. In addition, this performance improves significantly with the use of enhanced types of pavement markings that have high visibility during rain."
15472450.2011.544589,"Intelligent transportation systems–based lane management technologies were introduced to work zones in an attempt to reduce congestion and diminish queue lengths. Two forms of lane merging—the early merge and the late merge—were designed to advise drivers on definite merging locations. This study suggests two SDLMS—early merge and late merge—to supplement the current Florida Maintenance of Traffic (MOT) plans. Data were collected in work zones on I-95, Florida using three different traffic maintenance treatments. The first MOT plan treatment was the standard MOT used by the Florida Department of Transportation. The second MOT plan was the early SDLMS, and the third MOT was the late SDLMS. Results showed that the maximum queue discharge rate (or capacity) of the work zone was significantly higher for the early SDLMS compared to the conventional Florida Department of Transportation MOT plans. The late SDLMS did not result in significant increase in the work zone capacity. Moreover, results showed that early merging rate was the highest for the early SDLMS and the lowest for the late SDLMS, which suggests that some drivers were complying with the messages displayed by the system."
15472450.2011.570103,"Low-logging frequency GPS probe data have become a major data source for large-scale freeway network traffic monitoring. A critical step in GPS data processing is map matching. However, traditional map-matching algorithms are developed for in-vehicle navigation with high-logging frequency GPS data, noting that high-logging frequencies can be 1 s, whereas low-logging frequencies can be a few minutes. Such algorithms map a new GPS positioning point instantaneously given its historical points and network topology. Using high-logging frequency data-based map-matching algorithms for low-logging frequency data can cause several problems. First, large mapping errors in previous GPS points can easily propagate to the current points. Second, one-point-a-time processing is not effective and not necessary for traffic monitoring. Multiple GPS points can be processed together to determine routes more effectively. In this article, the authors propose a map-matching framework for low-logging frequency GPS probe data. The proposed framework (a) incorporates curve matching and probabilistic analysis modules of high-logging frequency map-matching algorithms and (b) introduces a new route determination algorithm for multipoint processing on the basis of fuzzy logic and a concurrent version of the N-shortest path algorithm. The authors evaluated the proposed model using field GPS data sets collected in Los Angeles, California. Evaluation methods include not only traditional random mapping case inspection but also a comparison between the GPS-detected speed and the ground truth loop-detector speed to evaluate its effectiveness for traffic monitoring. The evaluation results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework."
15472450.2011.570109,"Information about bus travel time and its variability is a key indicator of service performance, and it is valued by passengers and operators. Despite the important effect of traffic flow on bus travel time, previous predictive approaches have not fully considered a traffic measure making their predictions unresponsive to the dynamic changes in traffic congestion. In addition, existing methodologies have primarily concerned predicting average travel time given a certain set of input values. However, predicting travel-time variability has not received sufficient attention in previous research. This article proposes an integrated framework to predict bus average travel time and its variability on the basis of a range of input variables including traffic flow data. The framework is applied using GPS-based travel-time data for a bus route in Melbourne, Australia, in conjunction with dynamic traffic flow data collected by the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic Systems loop detectors and a measure of schedule adherence. Central to the framework are two artificial neural networks that are used to predict the average and variance of travel times for a certain set of input values. The outcomes are then used to construct a prediction interval corresponding to each input value set. The article demonstrates the ability of the proposed framework to provide robust prediction intervals. The article also explores the value that traffic flow data can provide to the accuracy of travel-time predictions compared with when either temporal variables or scheduled travel times are the base for prediction. While the use of scheduled travel times results in the poorest prediction performance, incorporating traffic flow data yields minor improvements in prediction accuracy compared with when temporal variables are used."
15472450.2011.570111,"Electronic screening (e-screening) sorts and diverts commercial vehicles that have a high likelihood of being overweight into a weigh station using weigh-in-motion technology. E-screening is known to add significant efficiency in operating weigh stations by allowing eligible trucks to bypass the in-station inspection, hence reducing the congestion at the weigh station. The primary goal of this study was twofold: (a) to develop a simulation model for describing the e-screening operation at truck weigh stations and (b) to analyze and evaluate the weigh station operation with varying values of affecting factors including the transponder penetration rate and the weigh-in-motion weight threshold. This study focuses the e-screening operation at a small weigh station with relatively short queuing area and heavy truck volumes, which is inevitably vulnerable to truck overflows and is sensitive to the prevailing transponder penetration rate and the weigh-in-motion threshold. The simulation results reveal that an e-screening operation can substantially improve the overweight enforcement and can reduce the travel time of legal trucks passing the test weigh station. The simulation results also demonstrate that properly adjusted weigh-in-motion thresholds can effectively enhance the overweight enforcement by preventing overweight trucks from being granted a false green light as a result of the erroneous weigh-in-motion measurement error. The study results also indicate that with the transponder penetration rate equal to or less than 20%, the e-screening benefits are relatively insignificant and adjusting the weigh-in-motion threshold may further deteriorate the enforcement efficiency."
15472450.2011.570114,"Travel time is an important measure for transportation system performance evaluation. In particular, it is an essential input to the advanced traveler information systems and route guidance applications that requires reliable traffic information in real time. Therefore, numerous studies have been conducted to predict segment and corridor travel times on the basis of data from loop detectors. Focusing on freeway corridor travel-time prediction that incorporates the effect of traffic propagation, this article presents a dynamic prediction model using the traffic measurements from presence-type vehicle detector data. The authors designed a multistep predictor in the form of a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model with an embedded adaptive Kalman filter that allows for continued adjustment of prediction results when new data become available in real time. The authors evaluated the corridor travel-time prediction method against 2 alternative methods using the same procedure as proposed, but one does not consider the effects of traffic propagation along the corridor and the other one does not perform the multiple-step traffic prediction. Along with the performance metrics, this study demonstrates the advantages of the model in capturing the dynamics of traffic and reveals the significant effects of traffic propagation on corridor travel-time prediction for producing more accurate prediction results. The authors also developed an online implementation framework."
15472450.2011.594669,"Transportation planning in general, and planning for intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) in particular, are notable for multiple goals and for multiple constituencies. A review of the current literature offers several ITS investment evaluation methods that provide frameworks for the quantification of risks and benefits. Nevertheless, the traditional selection methods overemphasize quantitative and economic analysis and often neglect to consider qualitative and noneconomic data in the formal selection process. Furthermore, crisp data are fundamentally indispensable in traditional ITS investment selection methods. However, the data in real-world problems are often imprecise or ambiguous. In this article, we propose a novel fuzzy group multi-criteria framework for ITS investment evaluation and selection that takes into consideration (1) the qualitative and quantitative criteria and their respective value judgments; (2) the verbal expressions and linguistic variables for qualitative judgments which lead to ambiguity in the decision process; and (3) imprecise or vague judgments. First, we use fuzzy TOPSIS to calculate the fuzzy risk values with each ITS architecture subsystem. Next, we use fuzzy ROA to calculate the fuzzy real option values of the ITS subsystems. Last, we determine the optimal investment schedule for the ITS subsystems by considering the risk and option values as the coefficients of the objective functions in a group multi-objective decision-making model."
15472450.2011.594681,"Communication systems are the basis of every effective and reliable traffic control and management application. While cellular-based communication through commercial carriers is widely used for online traffic management applications, public agencies have also begun to consider other technologies, such as WiFi and WiMAX. Most such agencies still seek additional guidelines for the selection of suitable wireless options for different traffic control and management applications under different physical and environmental conditions. Performance and reliability are among the most important parameters to be considered when examining wireless communication options for traffic control and management applications. The authors first conducted interviews with selected traffic agencies regarding their experiences with performance of wireless communication infrastructure, as well as their interests and plans on future expansion. Next, they conducted a thorough literature review focusing on various wireless technologies that could be used in an intelligent transportation system environment. Last, the authors conducted a case study in which a section of the South Carolina Department of Transportation traffic camera system was wirelessly connected via either WiFi or WiMAX network architecture. This case study followed the proposed network design process presented in the article using WiFi and WiMAX technologies to support a traffic surveillance system that considered coverage range and two different network topologies: mesh/ad hoc (devices forward data to neighboring devices to reach the destination) and infrastructure (devices send data to an access point directly). The network simulator ns-2 was used to assess the average throughput that each camera can receive in different network topologies. Throughput/cost analysis of WiFi and WiMAX mesh and infrastructure topologies indicated that for given number of devices, a mesh network has better throughput for every dollar spent than infrastructure based topology. This article provides a foundation for further investigation of WiFi and WiMAX performance and reliability under different network topologies. Findings from this research will benefit transportation agencies and other stakeholders in evaluating and selecting wireless communication options and network topologies for various traffic control and management applications."
15472450.2011.594691,"Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) attract considerable research and commercial interest with promising applications in a number of areas including cooperative vehicle-highways systems, sensor networks, and safety systems. However, as a result of high speed and variable driver behavior, automotive ad-hoc networks behave in fundamentally different ways to the most prevalent models in Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) research. Previous work in MANETs has mostly assumed that the mobile nodes move randomly with an unconstrained mobility model, and it is clear that a random mobility model is not adequate to represent the major characteristics of real-world vehicle motions and may therefore lead to unreliable results. Recent studies of VANETs have attempted to introduce macro- and micromobility constraints to model vehicle motions, but they have mostly focused on modeling the mobility of generic private vehicles. Given the potential for the coordinated deployment of network nodes on centrally managed fleet vehicles, it has become important to model the characteristics of a VANET featuring vehicles of different types, with systematically different behavior patterns. In this article, the authors study the connectivity of mobile ad-hoc networks that consist of buses moving in urban area and examine the implications for transport-related services. Buses have a unique set of behavior characteristics (e.g., fixed routes, schedules, bus stops, specific priorities), which gives rise to distinct effect on node connectivity in the communication network. Through extensive simulations on the basis of real bus routes in central London, the authors (a) demonstrated the effect of the locations of stops and the prevailing traffic patterns on node connectivity (including the distributions of contact duration and intercontact time between buses) and (b) explored its implication on the design of a dissemination system to capture and disseminate data. Their results give a key message that the mobility of buses has to be modeled explicitly, and such kind of knowledge of connectivity among buses will be significant for the studies of routing algorithms and other networking functions in interbus communication networks."
15472450.2011.620474,"Future road vehicles are expected to support point-to-point and long-range wireless connectivity as a standard feature, allowing data transfers while moving. In this vein, it is possible to forecast and develop new communication paradigms, as well as new infrastructures to take advantage of peculiarities of vehicular networks. This article introduces an optimized framework, on the basis of peer-to-peer principles, to manage content replication and dissemination through a mobile vehicular network. This is obtained through a discrete-time dynamic system over which an optimization problem must be solved in real time. Such a solution enables two different operations: (a) to overcome bandwidth limitations for distributing information among vehicles (e.g., traffic or security bulletins and multimedia contents) in an efficient way; (b) to use the vehicular flow as a virtual backbone to deliver data to different spatial locations without the need of a fixed network infrastructure. Simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with respect to classic peer-to-peer distribution schemes directly “ported” over the vehicular network. A direct comparison with an infrastructure-oriented solution is also presented."
15472450.2011.620478,"Despite the rapid development of concepts used in current map-matching algorithms, the continuous movement of a vehicle is often ignored or just limited to 1 or several previous matches. This may result in errors in complicated situations such as at Y-junctions, and entrance or exit ramps of a highway. The trajectory-based map-matching algorithm, which determines the matching road by comparing the vehicle trajectory against candidate roads, has the potential to overcome this limitation. However, the curve-to-curve matching as a simple form of trajectory-based map-matching fails to address this. The key issue of a trajectory-based map-matching algorithm is how to evaluate the similarity between the trajectory and the possible traveling roads. This article develops a synthetic fuzzy evaluation method to address the issue. The similarities are quantified in terms of location, shape, direction, and behavior. As a new input in map-matching, vehicle behavior refers to changes in the motion of the vehicle such as turning, which is restrained by the geometry of traveling road. The article also proposes a multilevel fuzzy synthetic evaluation process to assess the similarities and hierarchically synthesize them into a final evaluation. The method is evaluated using GPS positions recorded with a vehicle traveling in the urban area of Beijing, China. The traveled road paths include complicated roads conditions such as flyovers, highway entrances and exits. The method identifies more than 98% of the road segments correctly, showing a significant improvement over existing map-matching algorithms."
15472450.2011.620487,"Given a traffic network, the problem of identifying the smallest subset of links on which to locate sensors that allow the exact estimation of a given subset of links flows is dealt with, and methods for solving this partial link-observability problem are given. As sources of information, the authors consider 2 separate types of link sensors: counters and scanners. The first type leads to a method, which is an alternative to the previous method of Hu, Peeta, and Chu. First, the authors show how the previous method can be directly used for solving the partial observability problem. Next, the authors present a simple alternative algorithm, based on the pivoting strategy, that can include information about route and Origin-Destination (OD) flows observability. The observability problem based on scanners leads to a more difficult problem but supplies much more information about traffic flows. The authors give 2 simple algorithms for solving this problem in this case. The first algorithm allows checking that a given subset of links supplies the required information to estimate the flows in the selected subset of links, and provides information about route and OD observability. The second, which is a random algorithm, permits reducing the number of links of an initial subset of scanned links that solves the problem, and when a further reduction is not possible, modifies the initial set of scanning links for a new trial randomly. The proposed methods are illustrated using the parallel highway network of Hu, Peeta, and Chu. Last, the authors apply methods to two examples of applications—the Nguyen-Dupuis and the real Cuenca network—and provide some conclusions."
15472450.2011.620490,"Conventional vehicle-actuated traffic signal control attempts to achieve system optimum by ending a phase as soon as queues served during that phase vanish. In this article, the authors extend this logic to intersections where a stable cycle length is desirable (e.g., for signal coordination or other considerations). The proposed control scheme dynamically updates green allocation to keep queues on all approaches well balanced. Different from fully dynamic control strategies, the proposed quasi-dynamic scheme is based on a finite set of fixed timing plans with a common cycle length. The decision of switching from one plan to another is made at the beginning of each cycle based on the queue state in the previous cycle. Our experimental results showed that the performance of the proposed scheme is robust with respect to random fluctuation, systematic changes in demand, and input data quality. Although the proposed scheme does not attempt to minimize total system delay directly, it provides a good solution for reducing total system delay compared with the signal timing plan optimized for system delay. The preservation of a stable cycle length in the proposed signal timing plan has made it possible to incorporate the proposed scheme into the development of control strategies for an arterial where signal coordination is essential to the performance of the system."
15472450.2012.639635,"Autonomous vehicles are becoming a reality. In particular, podcars were already launched in pilot projects. The wide use of such vehicles for personal transportation in urban areas is then just a matter of time and poses several research challenges and technical issues to the artificial intelligence and multiagent communities. This article focuses on issues related to the processing of demands for these vehicles and on routing them in an efficient way. An agent-based approach is proposed, which considers some variants for the processing of demands and for the routing. First, a centralized version is discussed. Then, extensions deal with decentralized routing, with enroute planning, intervehicle communication, and with a market-based approach where the manager of the service runs an auction to determine which customer to serve. All these variants aim at testing alternatives in order to shed light onto questions such as how the podcar service is to be provided and how trips have to be planned, as well as address challenges related to the management. Results show that, although this service can be provided by a central authority, communication, as well as reliability and fault-tolerance, should not be neglected."
15472450.2012.639640,"Lane-changing maneuvers of heavy vehicles have significant influence on surrounding traffic characteristics because of the physical effects that the heavy vehicles impose on surrounding vehicles. These effects are the result of heavy vehicles’ length, size, weight, and limitations in their maneuverability. Because of the importance of heavy vehicle lane-changing maneuvers, this article presents an exclusive fuzzy logic lane-changing decision model with 2 and 3 fuzzy sets for heavy vehicle drivers on freeways. To examine the accuracy of the heavy vehicle drivers’ lane-changing decision model, the authors compared the number of estimated lane-changing maneuvers of heavy vehicles with the observed number of heavy vehicle lane-changing maneuvers. In addition, the authors compared estimated traffic flow measurements (e.g., traffic flow, average speed) with the observed traffic flow measurements through microscopic traffic simulations. Results show that the fuzzy logic heavy vehicle lane-changing model can better replicate the observed lane-changing decisions of heavy vehicle drivers than can the current lane-changing decision models. Furthermore, using an exclusive heavy vehicle lane-changing decision model can increase the accuracy of the microscopic traffic simulation software in estimating the macroscopic traffic flow measurements."
15472450.2012.639641,Adaptive cruise control (ACC) can potentially improve quality-of-service and safety and reduce the environmental effect of the road traffic system. This article uses vehicle trajectories from traffic simulation to study effects of ACC on vehicle acceleration and deceleration rates. The analysis is based on traffic simulations with car-following models including ACC functionality and driver behavior in ACC-equipped as well as standard nonequipped vehicles. The simulation results show that ACC can improve the traffic situation in terms of reduced acceleration and deceleration rates even though macroscopic traffic properties may remain uninfluenced. This supports the hypothesized positive road safety and environmental effects of ACC. It is also established that the results are largely dependent on the assumptions made regarding driver behavior in ACC-equipped and standard vehicles. It is consequently crucial to include appropriate assumptions regarding driver behavior in traffic simulation–based analyses of ACC.
15472450.2012.671706,"This article presents an autonomic-based architecture for real-time traffic management in congested urban transportation networks. The architecture assumes the availability of spatially distributed controllers in the network. Each controller is capable of monitoring the traffic within a predefined subnetwork and provides efficient control strategies for its traffic. Controllers are assumed to be able to share information on the observed traffic pattern and their control actions. In addition, controllers could be dynamically configured to operate in teams to develop integrated traffic management schemes that best cope with the observed traffic pattern in the network. The article presents the results of a set of off-line experiments that examine the performance of the proposed architecture. The experiments evaluate the most efficient team-formation strategies among controllers to mitigate a nonrecurrent traffic congestion situation in a typical highway network. The results show that more efficient traffic management strategies could be obtained through collaboration among individual controllers and could result in considerable travel time savings."
15472450.2012.671708,"Most transit trip planning systems are based on static schedules and generate trips that do not dynamically respond to delays in transit operation caused by traffic congestion or accidents. In addition, the driving-parking-then-transit travel mode is common in metropolitan areas. However, very few transit trip planners incorporate real-time transit data into this mode. This article describes a multimodal trip planning system for multiple modes: driving, transit, and driving-parking-then-transit. The system considers the real-time transit arrival time, which is estimated by a prediction model. Both Web-based and mobile phone-based clients are used to access the system. Case studies show that the multimodal trip planning system works well in real-life situations."
15472450.2012.671709,"In this article, we present a methodology for assessing the benefits of different vehicle coordination strategies on the safety of a platoon during emergency braking. One can say that a coordinated braking strategy B is more beneficial than a strategy A, if strategy B leads to a larger reduction in the probability of a collision, the expected number of collisions, and the expected relative velocity at impact as compared to strategy A. We consider an emergency braking scenario, in which the lead vehicle brakes at its maximum capability and the following vehicles coordinate their braking. The sequence of maximum braking capability (i.e., deceleration) of vehicles in the platoon is assumed to be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables; this distribution is assumed to be discrete and known. Due to coordination among vehicles, however, the “effective” deceleration of a following vehicle may not necessarily be its maximum value. The problem of assessing the benefits of coordination can be formulated as three subproblems. The first subproblem deals with determining the probability distribution of the “effective” deceleration of following vehicles during emergency braking. It is intuitive that the smaller the variance of this distribution, the greater the safety benefits are. We define three metrics of safety through the concept of a violation. A violation occurs in a platoon if the “effective” deceleration of a following vehicle is smaller than that of its predecessor. The second subproblem deals with determining the probability of occurrence of a violation, expected number of violations, and the expected relative velocity corresponding to a possible collision as a function of the difference in the braking capabilities of successive vehicles in a platoon. The probability of an intervehicular collision and the expected number of collisions are related to the probability of a violation and the expected number of violations, respectively. The concept of a violation circumvents the need for a detailed consideration of the mechanics of a collision. A method is provided here to compute these metrics of safety using a Markov chain. The third subproblem deals with conducting Monte Carlo simulation to corroborate the safety benefits of coordination during emergency braking and the viability of our analytical approach to provide the correct trend."
15472450.2012.671711,"Traffic congestion is getting worse and has resulted in increased travel delays and costs. In order to develop effective intelligent transportation systems (ITS) strategies to mitigate traffic congestion on freeways, a good understanding of its causes and impacts is vital but has not been achieved at a satisfactory level. Over the past several decades, deterministic queuing theory (DQT) has been widely used to evaluate freeway travel delays resulted from traffic congestion. However, several studies evaluated the accuracy of its delay estimates and claimed that the DQT method consistently underestimates vehicle delays. The reason for the underestimation, however, had not been clearly identified. This study aims at exploring the main cause of such underestimation problems and proposing a solution to fix it. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical justification, it was found the underestimation resulted primarily from the inappropriate estimates of the time offsets, that is, the travel times between the queue starting point and the immediate upstream and downstream traffic sensor locations. To address this issue, a microscopic approach was developed and implemented in a computer application to enhance the time offset estimation. This proposed approach was tested using the real vehicle delay data manually extracted from traffic surveillance video cameras. The test results indicated that the improved DQT-based vehicle delay estimates with appropriate time offset settings were very close to the ground-truth data. The underestimation problem associated with the traditional DQT method can be effectively addressed and fairly accurate estimates of vehicle delay can be achieved by the proposed method."
15472450.2012.671713,"Rail systems are highly complex and their control requires mathematical-computational tools. The main drawback of the models used to represent railway traffic, and to resolve any conflicts that occur, is the large computational time needed to obtain satisfactory results. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to study and design a discrete event-based model, characterized by the positioning of trains in block sections, that can represent the rail system, including the dynamic aspect, and a fixed block signaling system able to proactively detect and resolve potential conflicts that may occur within this system. This model can be developed and integrated as a specific module of a railway passenger-dedicated intelligent transportation systems (ITS) oriented to real-time traffic management in order to improve the service quality of a railway system's operations. The aim is to reduce the computational cost as much as possible and implement the proposed model in a railway network. A numerical investigation based on the Renfe Cercanís Madrid rail network (Spain) shows the high computational performance of the proposed approach in a real-life application context."
15472450.2012.688384,"To extract useful information on variables that are associated with secondary accident likelihood, this article develops neural network models with enhanced explanatory power. Traffic and weather conditions at the occurrence of a primary incident are explicitly considered. Two measures to extract variable significance are introduced: mutual information and partial derivatives. The proposed approach is also compared to other classical statistical approaches of the Logit family. Results suggest that traffic speed, duration of the primary accident, hourly volume, rainfall intensity, and number of vehicles involved in the primary accident are the top five factors associated with secondary accident likelihood. However, changes in traffic speed and volume, number of vehicles involved, blocked lanes, and percentage of trucks and upstream geometry also significantly influence the probability of having a secondary incident. Finally, the incident management implications of the proposed modeling approach are discussed."
15472450.2012.688388,"The purpose of this article is to develop a framework for assessing the effects of tour information systems and information dissemination strategies by incorporating tourists’ decision processes into an activity-based model. There are two important features in tourists’ decision-making processes: (1) They generally have limited information and experiences on tour sites, and (2) their value of time is higher than normal travelers' because of their time limitations. These two features are, however, the main reasons that make tour information services attractive to tourists and thus should also be incorporated into a modeling framework for investigating the effects of the real-time tour information system. This study develops an agent-based simulation model that incorporates activity chaining behavior into tour scheduling systems. The underlying assumption used in the model is that tourists schedule their activities within their time and budget constraints to maximize their utilities. The model seeks individuals’ optimal tour schedules by solving a prize-collecting multiple-day traveling salesman problem (PC-MD-TSP). The simulation model also includes real-time and end-of-day rescheduling capabilities by taking tourists’ unpredicted delays into consideration. From a numerical test, the pros and cons of tour information services are found and the optimal strategy for a tour information service is also discussed. The results show that tour information services increase tourists’ satisfaction with less expenditure by allowing tourists to visit more places in an effective way."
15472450.2012.691842,"This article investigates the factors affecting drivers’ stated behavior in adverse visibility conditions and examines whether drivers rely on and follow advisory or warning messages displayed on portable changeable message signs (CMS) and/or variable speed limit (VSL) signs in different visibility and traffic conditions, and on two types of roadways: freeways and two-lane roads. A multiple-approach survey was designed to collect opinions and stated data from Central Florida drivers. Categorical data analysis techniques such as conditional distribution, odds ratio, and chi-squared tests were applied. In addition, two modeling approaches, bivariate and multivariate probit models, were estimated. The results revealed that gender, age, road type, visibility condition, and familiarity with VSL sign were the significant factors affecting the stated likelihood of reducing speed following CMS/VSL instructions in reduced visibility conditions. Other objectives of this study were to determine the content of messages that would achieve the best perceived safety and drivers’ compliance and to examine the best way to improve safety during these adverse visibility conditions. The results indicated that respondents thought that “Caution–fog ahead–reduce speed” was the best message and that using that CMS and VSL signs together was the best way to improve safety during such inclement weather situations. Based on the findings of the present study, several recommendations are suggested as guidelines to improve safety in reduced visibility"
15472450.2012.691852,"Map-matching algorithms integrate data from positioning sensors with a digital map in order, first, to identify the road link on which a vehicle is traveling, and second, to determine the vehicle's location on that link. Due to errors in positioning sensors, digital maps, and the map-matching (MM) process, MM algorithms sometimes fail to identify the correct road segment from the candidate segments. This phenomenon is known as mismatching. Identification of the wrong road link may mislead users and degrade the performance of a location-based intelligent transportation system (ITS) and services. The main objective of this article is to improve a topological map-matching (tMM) algorithm by error detection, correction, and performance re-evaluation. Errors in a tMM algorithm were determined using data comprising 62,887 positioning points collected in three different countries (the United Kingdom, the United States, and India). After map-matching, each mismatched case was examined to identify the primary causes of the mismatches. A number of strategies were developed and applied to reduce the risk of mismatching thus enhancing the tMM algorithm. An independent data set of 5,256 positioning points collected in and around Nottingham, UK, was employed to re-evaluate the performance of the enhanced tMM algorithm. The original tMM algorithm correctly identified the vehicle's position 96.5% of the time; after enhancement this increased to 97.8%. This compares very well with the performance of tMM algorithms reported in the literature. The enhanced tMM algorithm developed in this research is simple, fast, efficient, and easy to implement. Since the accuracy offered by the enhanced algorithm is found to be high, the developed algorithm has potential to be implemented in real-time location-based ITS applications."
15472450.2012.694788,"Effective use of loop detector data for traffic management requires that errors be efficiently detected, diagnosed, and corrected. We present two new spatial approaches and compare them to state-of-the-art correction procedures for station flow estimation when detectors within that station malfunction in nonincident conditions. One new method exploits the relationship between individual detector flow and station flow using linear regression. The second incorporates lane use percentages through kernel regression. To comprehensively compare the procedures, systematic and random-error evaluations are conducted for two detector stations with distinct lane configurations. Lane configuration is important for spatial correction methods, which perform well under certain detector failure combinations. The random-error evaluation indicates that temporal correction performs better at all error levels and spatial approaches are inaccurate under light traffic conditions, especially when estimates are based on zero flow readings. When choosing a correction procedure, one should consider facility configurations, error types and magnitudes, and traffic conditions, and calibrate the method for location-specific characteristics."
15472450.2012.704340,"The purpose of this study was to identify the safety impacts of speed limiters in commercial truck fleets. The primary safety analysis was a focus on the reduction in truck crashes that could have been avoided or mitigated with an active speed limiter installed on the truck. This was the first study to use actual truck crash data collected directly from commercial truck fleets, representing a wide array of crashes. The study included data from 20 commercial truck fleets, including approximately 138,000 truck-years and more than 15,000 truck crashes, as they operated under real-world, revenue-producing deliveries. The findings showed strong positive benefits for speed limiters. Results indicated that trucks equipped without speed limiters had a significantly higher speed limiter-relevant crash rate (approximately 200%) compared to trucks with speed limiters. The cost of the technology is negligible and would not be expected to be cost-prohibitive for commercial truck fleets/owners. The current study went further than any prior research conducted in this domain and provides important data on the efficacy of speed limiters in reducing speed limiter-relevant crashes."
15472450.2012.706196,"Traffic speed and length-based vehicle classification data are critical inputs for traffic operations, pavement design and maintenance, and transportation planning. However, they cannot be measured directly by single-loop detectors, the most widely deployed type of traffic sensor in the existing roadway infrastructure. In this study, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based approach is developed to estimate more accurate traffic speeds and classified vehicle volumes using single-loop outputs. The estimation procedure consists of multiple iterations of parameter correction and validation. After the GMM is established to empirically model vehicle on-times measured by single-loop detectors, the optimal solution can be initially sought to separate length-based vehicle volume data. Based on the on-time of the separated short vehicles from the GMM, an iterative process will be conducted to improve traffic speed and classified volume estimation until the estimation results become statistically stable and converge. This method is straightforward and computationally efficient. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was examined using data collected from several loop stations on Interstate 90 in the Seattle area. The traffic volume data for three vehicle classes are categorized based on the proposed method. The test results show the proposed GMM approach outperforms the previous models, including conventional constant g-factor method, sequence method, and moving median method, and produces more reliable, accurate estimates of traffic speeds and classified vehicle volumes under various traffic conditions."
15472450.2012.710159,"Transport telematic systems, also known as intelligent transportation systems, can be expensive to implement but the services they provide may offer substantial benefits. However, what services the system can provide depends on the architectural choices made, which also affects the cost of the system. We propose an optimization model to support a more informed decision before investing in a multiple service transport telematic system. The model evaluates the possible choices of services and architectures, and aims to maximize the total net societal benefit. We argue that the optimization model can provide support for strategic decisions by highlighting the consequences of adopting different system architectures, including both societal value and cost. This can be useful for decision makers, such as governments, road transport telematic service providers, and commercial road freight transport operators."
15472450.2012.710156,"Truck processing time, including the processing time per lane and per truck at a specific timestamp, at marine container terminal gates is crucial for measuring the performance of terminals. Truck processing time has traditionally been collected for short periods of time (e.g., a few hours) through field observation. From the surveillance cameras widely available at terminal gates, researchers have attempted to collect truck processing time data by manually reviewing camera images frame by frame. However, this manual review process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This study is motivated by the need for effectively collecting truck processing times over a long period of time. An image-processing algorithm to automatically extract truck processing time data using the low-frame-rate images (less than 1 frame per second, fps) is first proposed. The proposed algorithm includes three steps: (1) design of two region of interest (ROIs) per lane to capture truck trajectories, (2) a frame-differencing change-detection algorithm addressing the low frame rate and cast shadow issue, and (3) a unique state transition model with a set of decision rules, considering perspective occlusion and other potential sources of false positive detections, to reliably detect truck departures. An experimental test using one day's actual images in varying conditions was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental tests have demonstrated the robustness of the proposed algorithm's ability to meet the unique technical challenges at a terminal gate, including the following: day and night conditions, cast shadows, occlusion by work vehicles, people, and nearby trucks. An experimental test using 7,225 images (6,567 day and 658 night operation images) was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental tests have also demonstrated the robustness of the proposed algorithm for successfully detecting truck departures under several challenging situations, including perspective occlusion, cast shadows, nighttime and various lighting conditions, and multiple-lane departures. The correct detection rate is 98.1% for daytime images and 90.8% for nighttime images, giving our data a correct detection rate of 97.6%."

The intended audience of the paper includes young transportation researchers and professionals. Current transportation models are divided into “generations” based on their technological and practical background. Based on the trends in the past and the potential technologies to be implemented in the future, general characteristics of the next generations of transportation models are proposed and discussed to provide a vision regarding expected future achievements in transportation research.

15472450.2012.704336,"This article conducts a realistic assessment, using a real-world case study, of the likely environmental benefits of an intelligent transportation systems (ITS) strategy that provides dynamic route guidance to travelers based on the lowest emission or fuel consumption routes. Several features distinguish this study from previous reported research. First, the research utilizes a realistic case study of a medium-sized metropolitan area in the United States. Second, the research applies the latest state-of-the-art models on both the transportation and the environmental modeling sides, through the development of an integrated model combining the Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) model and the Multi-Scale Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator model (MOVES). The integrated model is then used to approximate “green user equilibrium,” and to investigate the impact of market penetration on the likely environmental benefits of green routing. Third, the article also proposes a “targeted” traveler selection strategy whereby travelers with the greatest potential to reduce emissions or fuel consumption are selected for rerouting. Results indicate that green routing could result in significant reductions in emissions, but that this naturally comes at the expense of an increased travel time. For one scenario that considered assuming a traffic stream of only passenger cars, green routing resulted in an almost 13% reduction in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, and a corresponding 8% increase in travel time. The results also indicate that tangible emissions reductions are achievable at low to medium market penetration levels for green routing applications, especially when travelers with the largest likely emissions savings are targeted."
15472450.2012.716639,"Optimization of traffic network performance using dynamic traffic management (DTM) measures can be viewed as a specific example of solving a network design problem (NDP). Decision variables are the specific settings of DTM measures. DTM measures have been identified as powerful instruments not only to increase network efficiency, but also to improve externalities. As a result, in the optimization the focus is not only on efficiency, but also on climate, air quality, traffic safety, and noise. These assessment criteria are determined using the output of a dynamic traffic assignment model. This results in a dynamic multi-objective NDP, which is solved as a bilevel optimization problem; it results in a Pareto optimal set. This set provides valuable information for the decision-making process, which would not have been available if the compensation principle would have been chosen in advance. Knowledge obtained by optimization of realistic cases can be used to attain knowledge about incorporation of externalities as an objective when optimizing traffic systems using DTM measures. A case study for a realistic network of the city of Almelo shows that the objectives efficiency, climate, and air quality are mainly aligned and mainly opposed to traffic safety and noise. However, there is not a single solution that optimizes all three aligned objectives. Based on the Pareto optimal set, the trade-offs are determined and using cluster analysis the solutions and results are further analyzed for network segments."
15472450.2012.719455,"This article evaluates the impacts of dynamic speed limit strategies in metropolitan freeways. An objective function is defined in order to balance the benefits (e.g., reduction of congestion, pollutant emissions and fuel consumption, or increase in traffic safety) and costs (e.g., increase of free flow travel times). This function is generic in its nature, and could be used to assess any type of traffic management strategy. In particular, it is applied to the Barcelona's freeways dynamic speed limit management case study. The results suggest that the social profitability of dynamic speed limit (DSL) management in metropolitan freeways is limited. The main reason for this is the reduced effect of this kind of policy, if isolated in application, in alleviating congestion. It is emphasized that the absolute magnitude of the profitability is highly sensitive to the value given to each one of the social costs. The profitability of the policy would improve if the value of traffic externalities increased in relation to the marginal cost of travel times. A sensitivity analysis with respect to this last cost is presented. The potential synergies of applying DSL strategies jointly with other active traffic management policies should be considered as an issue for further research."
15472450.2012.716663,"Network planning and traffic flow optimization require the acquisition and analysis of large quantities of data such as the network topology, its traffic flow data, vehicle fleet composition, emission measurements and so on. Data acquisition is an expensive process that involves household surveys and automatic as well as semiautomatic measurements performed all over the network. For example, in order to accurately estimate the effect of a certain network change on the total emissions produced by vehicles in the network, assessment of the vehicle fleet composition for each origin–destination pair is required. As a result, problems that optimize nonlocal merit functions become highly difficult to solve. One such problem is finding the optimal deployment of traffic monitoring units. In this article we suggest a new traffic assignment model that is based on the concept of shortest path betweenness centrality measure, borrowed from the domain of complex network analysis. We show how betweenness can be augmented in order to solve the traffic assignment problem given an arbitrary travel cost definition. The proposed traffic assignment model is evaluated using a high-resolution Israeli transportation data set derived from the analysis of cellular phones data. The group variant of the augmented betweenness centrality is then used to optimize the locations of traffic monitoring units, hence reducing the cost and increasing the effectiveness of traffic monitoring."
15472450.2013.784653,"Bluetooth media access control (MAC) identification (ID) detection has been effectively used for near real-time traffic monitoring. Its continuous data collection capability by sampling actual traffic makes it feasible for permanent installation in the road with minimal cost and better data accuracy, both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, the delay calculated with simple matching of MAC IDs has some inherent errors due to the frequency hopping structure of Bluetooth detections. The detections of a Bluetooth device in a traveling vehicle can be thought of as random events varying in space and time. This article presents two models to calculate traffic control delay based on synchronized Bluetooth and global positioning system (GPS) probe vehicle data. The two models are based on the number of Bluetooth observed detections and the time duration between the first and the last detections. The proposed models were found to be more accurate than the existing practice and have the potential to be used for estimating intersection approach level-of-service (LOS) in near real time for evaluating and optimizing signal timing plans."
15472450.2012.696452,"Several approaches for travel time data collection based on the reading of time-stamped media access control addresses from Bluetooth-enabled devices have been reported in the literature recently. This new approach offers a number of advantages over more conventional methods, including lower costs of hardware and software, the volume of data that can be collected over time, and ease of implementation. A fundamental component that may affect the quantity and the quality of the travel time samples collected with a Bluetooth-based system is the antenna type utilized. Antenna characteristics such as polarization and gain must be matched to specific application environments to optimize the performance of a Bluetooth reader unit. However, experimental data that focuses on antenna characterization as it relates to the use of Bluetooth technology to assess the performance of transportation facilities is lacking. In this study, five different types of antennas were characterized to assess their suitability to support a Bluetooth-based travel time data collection system. The results indicate that vertically polarized antennas with gains between 9dBi and 12dBi are good candidates for travel time data collection. Also, different antenna types are better suited to different uses of the Bluetooth-based system. If the main focus is the collection of travel time data, then an antenna with a lower sampling rate may provide more accurate travel time samples."
15472450.2012.696449,"Anonymous probe vehicle monitoring systems are being developed to measure travel times on highways and arterials based on wireless signals available from technologies such as Bluetooth. Probe vehicle data can provide accurate measurements of current traffic speeds and travel times due to their excellent spatial coverage. However, presently probe vehicles are only a small portion of the vehicles that make up all of the traffic in the network. Alternatively, data from conventional loop detectors cover almost all the vehicles that have traveled along a road section, resulting in excellent temporal coverage. Unfortunately, loop detector measurements can be imprecise; their spatial sampling depends on the loop detector spacing, and they typically only represent traffic speed at the location of the detector and not over the entire road segment. With this complementarity in mind, this article explores several data fusion techniques for fusing data from these sources together. All methods are implemented and compared in terms of their ability to fuse data from loop detectors and probe vehicles to accurately estimate freeway traffic speeds. Data from a Bluetooth traffic monitoring system are fused with corresponding loop detector data and compared against GPS collected probe vehicle data on a stretch of Highway 401 in Toronto, Canada. The analysis shows that through data fusion, even a few probe vehicle measurements from a Bluetooth traffic monitoring system can improve the accuracy of traffic speed estimates traditionally obtained from loop detectors."
15472450.2012.748555,"Reliable travel time prediction enables both users and system controllers to be well informed of the future conditions on roadways. This in turn helps with informed pre-trip plans and effective traffic control strategies. This article studies short-time travel time prediction for stochastic freeway applications using real time Bluetooth travel time data. A set of four prediction models including historical average, auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Kalman filter, and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), are implemented. A modified nonparametric model KNN-T is proposed that considers the traffic pattern features to enhance the basic KNN model with trend adjustment. The results of the prediction performances of each model from the case studies are investigated and reported. Results indicated that both nonparametric models, the basic KNN and KNN-T, outperformed the historical average, ARIMA, and Kalman filter models by decreasing the MAPE more than 10% for the all-day period and 20% for peak-hour periods in prediction accuracy. The proposed KNN-T model displayed 2.5% to 4.8% decrease in MAPE than KNN model for all-day and peak-hour periods, respectively, indicating that the KNN-T model captures not only the value but also the time-varying trend, which would lead to a more precise match with the future traffic conditions."
15472450.2012.712495,"Motor vehicles are significant contributors to urban air pollution and greenhouse gases. Common practice for estimating vehicle emissions in California calls for integrating travel forecasting models and emission models. However, static travel forecasting models are incapable of generating the detailed vehicle activity required for emission estimates. Further, the fleet mix is also assumed to be constant across different roadways and at all times of day. Therefore, this article attempts to develop a new approach to measure travel activity and vehicle mix using existing inductive loop detector data. However, this study does not intend to forecast future vehicle activity. The study found that current practices overestimate speeds as much as 5–25 mph, whereas the proposed method overestimates speed about 2 mph, compared to ground-truth speeds in a freeway corridor. Furthermore, contrary to current practice, the proposed model distinguishes the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) between light-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles in each link. The current practice overestimates or underestimates emissions by 1–20% during different times of day, whereas the proposed method underestimates the emissions by about 3%. We conclude that the proposed approach can provide a cost-effective way of estimating reliable emission inventory and estimating time-dependent emission inventories for different pollutants."
15472450.2012.704338,"The traditional methodology for estimating vehicle emissions based on vehicle miles traveled and average speed is not reliable because it does not consider the effects of congestion, control devices, and driving mode (cruise, acceleration, deceleration, and idle). We developed an analytical model to predict vehicle activity on signalized arterials with emphasis on oversaturated traffic conditions. The model depends only on loop detector data and signal settings as inputs and provides estimates of the time spent in each driving mode, which consequently leads to more accurate vehicle emission estimates. The application of the proposed model on a real-world arterial shows that it accurately estimates the time spent and consequently the emissions per driving mode. We also applied the model to evaluate the effectiveness of signal timing optimization in reducing vehicle emissions."
15472450.2012.716670,"Most existing intersection signals are timed based on delay minimization. However, minimizing delay does not necessarily lead to the minimization of emissions at an intersection. No study has focused on the difference or the trade-off between delay based and emissions based signal optimization. Delay-based optimization typically uses macroscopic flow conditions such as traffic demands, saturation flow rates, and average delay. However, the latest emission model, MOVES (Motor Vehicle Emission Simulation), requires second-by-second individual vehicle speed profiles, which makes the model difficult to formulate directly in an emission-based signal optimization problem. This study first develops a methodology to derive vehicle profiles given macroscopic inputs so that MOVES can be applied to estimating emissions. Then an optimization methodology of signal timing is developed and solved with a genetic algorithm. The objective function of the optimization problem considers both delay and emissions, with the signal timing elements being the decision variables. Through a case study, the air quality benefit by reducing vehicle emissions through intersection signal control is demonstrated, and the trade-off between operational and emission performance measures is investigated. Furthermore, the air quality benefit from intersection signal control is discussed under different scenarios of cycle lengths, percentages of turning vehicles, and traffic demands on major/minor roads."
15472450.2012.716641,"The transportation sector consumes about 28% of the total energy expended by all sectors in the United States, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This article proposes a renewable wind power system (RWPS) as an alternative power source for a signalized traffic intersection. The RWPS can be mounted on existing transportation infrastructure to provide green energy. Large-scale implementation of such a system has the potential to change the role of the public right-of-way from an energy consumer to an energy producer. This article provides a framework to investigate the physical and economic feasibility of installing an RWPS. Methodologies to conduct a structural analysis, site selection, and economic analysis are developed. A case study for an intersection in Lincoln, Nebraska, is used to demonstrate the application of evaluation procedures. The benefits of an RWPS are twofold: (a) the power generated by such a system can support the operation of traffic signals and any excess power produced can be sold back to the power grid; and (b) an RWPS provides a source of backup power in case of grid failure and thus increases the traffic network reliability. This article presents the methodologies to determine the economic value of an RWPS for both cases just described. The costs and benefits of providing RWPS are stated in dollar values. The decision to install an RWPS at an intersection can be made using a benefit–cost ratio. The case study shows that the RWPS is economically feasible at the subject intersection. The results also show that intersections with frequent power failures will have higher benefit–cost ratios. In the event of budget constraints, the methodologies developed in this article can be used to prioritize the investments."
15472450.2012.716651,"This article proposes a methodology that can be applied to evaluate the environmental and energy impacts of a de novo technology, the automated electric highway systems (AEHS). The authors used the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) program to estimate the impacts on emissions and energy use associated with a hypothetical implementation of this technology on the Interstate 70 corridor in Missouri during the period 2011–2040. The estimation results suggest that application of AEHS on the study corridor would decrease fossil fuel energy use by more than 25%, while emissions would decrease by up to 27%, depending on the pollutant being considered. A sensitivity analysis was also performed, in order to assess the impact of different demand estimates for the system; a 10% reduction in AEHS vehicle miles traveled would have an effect of 5% or less on the criteria of interest. This article represents one of the first attempts to quantify the environmental benefits of this widely discussed technology, and can serve as a guiding methodology for evaluation of upcoming intelligent transportation system technologies."
15472450.2012.721330,"Mainstream traffic flow control (MTFC) on freeways, enabled via variable speed limits (VSL), is a traffic management tool capable of avoiding or, at least, postponing congestion formation on freeway bottlenecks, and may complement other existing measures. Two simple feedback controllers for local MTFC via VSL are proposed. Both controllers are evaluated and compared to a previously developed local MTFC feedback cascade controller and to a sophisticated optimal control approach. All feedback controllers rely on readily available real-time measurements, are simple and robust, and take into account a number of practical and safety restrictions; therefore, they are suitable for implementation in the field as a new or as part of an existing intelligent transportation systems infrastructure. The evaluations are conducted for a hypothetical freeway network by use of a validated second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. The results show that the feedback controllers exhibit a satisfactory control behavior and, indeed, approach the optimal control results. Recommendations for the operation of the feedback controllers are given."
15472450.2012.729380,"This article presents a priority signal control model for multiple bus requests. The proposed model aims to generate the optimal priority serving sequence to maximize the utilization of available green times by buses, but not to incur excessive congestion for other vehicular traffic. This study first depicts the serving sequence for multiple priority requests as a multistage decision process and explicitly models three bus priority strategies under the constraints of minimum green time, acceptable degree of saturation, and length of priority window. Further, it formulates a dynamic programming model to optimize the serving sequence for multiple priority requests as well as the corresponding signal timing plans under various levels of bus occupancy, schedule deviation, and traffic demand. A rolling time horizon approach is employed to solve the proposed model in real time. Comparative analysis results have shown that the proposed dynamic programming model outperforms the first-come-first-serve policy in terms of reducing bus delays, improving schedule adherence, and minimizing the impacts on other vehicular traffic. Computational performance analysis has further demonstrated the potential of the proposed model and algorithm to be applied in real-time bus priority control system."
15472450.2013.771105,"Safety and quality of travel on arterial networks tie closely to the performance of signalized intersections. Measures commonly used for intersection performance evaluations are control delay, queue length, and cycle failure. However, these variables are not directly available from typical configurations of traffic sensors designed for intersection signal control. Collecting vehicle control delay data manually for intersection performance measurement has been a task too time-consuming and labor-intensive to be practical. Video image processors (VIPs) have been increasingly deployed for intersection signal control in recent years. This study aims to use the extra detection capabilities of VIPs for performance monitoring at signalized intersections. Most VIPs can support up to 24 virtual loops, but normally less than half of the virtual loops are used. By properly configuring the spare virtual loops and analyzing the loop measurements, intersection performance can be monitored in real time. In this research, we propose an approach for measuring queue length and vehicle control delay at signalized intersections based on traffic count data collected with traffic sensors. This algorithm has been implemented in a computerized system called In-PerforM. The In-PerforM system was evaluated by both field tests and simulation experiments. Although the VIPs’ counting errors do affect the accuracy of field test results, we still received encouraging results on queue lengths and control delay measurements in both the field tests and simulation experiments. This demonstrates that the In-PerforM system, and therefore the proposed algorithm, has the potential to be a cost-effective approach for performance measurement at signalized intersections."
15472450.2013.801717,"This article deals with the application of artificial neural networks to model car following drivers’ behavior. The study is based on experimental data collected by several global positioning system-equipped vehicles that follow each other on urban roads. A “swarm” stochastic evolutionary algorithm has been applied in the training phase to improve convergence of the usual error-back propagation algorithm. Validation tests show that artificial neural networks (ANNs) provide a good approximation of driving patterns. Therefore, ANN can be suitably implemented in microsimulation models. In this regard, a new experimental calibration method for microsimulation software might consist of training one specific ANN for each representative individual of the driver population through systematic observations in the field or in virtual environment trials."
15472450.2013.773250,"Optimization of externalities and accessibility using dynamic traffic management measures on a strategic level is a specific example of solving a multi-objective network design problem. Solving this optimization problem is time consuming, because heuristics like evolutionary multi objective algorithms are needed and solving the lower level requires solving the dynamic user equilibrium problem. Using function approximation like response surface methods (RSM) in combination with evolutionary algorithms could accelerate the determination of the Pareto optimal set. Three algorithms in which RSM are used in different ways in combination with the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2+ (SPEA2+) are compared with employing the SPEA2+ without the use of these methods. The results show that the algorithms using RSM methods accelerate the search considerably at the start, but tend to converge more quickly, possibly to a local optimum, and therefore loose their head start. Therefore, usage of function approximation is mainly of interest if a limited number of exact evaluations can be done or this can be used as a pre phase in a hybrid approach."
15472450.2013.802156,"This article analyzes the role of advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) in conjunction with signal setting (SS) design. ATIS and SS are considered as planning options for network optimization under recurrent traffic conditions. The traffic network is considered in within-day static, as is usual for planning-oriented models. Both day-to-day static (equilibrium) and dynamic states are investigated. Notably, equilibrium and stability can influence the feasibility of SS solutions. In addition, the role of ATIS is assessed with regard to its suitability in equilibrating SS optima and/or stabilizing SS equilibria. Travelers’ compliance with information, which plays a crucial role in both optimization and stabilization, is explicitly modeled. A formal modeling framework is introduced, allowing SS and ATIS to be represented, and several benefits and drawbacks of SS and ATIS options are explored. The model is then used for simulations on a hypothetical network. The results suggest the potential of the modeling framework and lead to nontrivial findings about the role of ATIS."
15472450.2013.773225,"In real-time traffic management and intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications, an accurate picture of the prevailing traffic state in terms of speeds and densities is critical, for which traffic state estimation methods are needed. The most popular and effective techniques used are so-called model-based traffic state estimators, which consist of a dynamic traffic flow model to predict the evolution of the state variables; a set of observation equations relating sensor observations to the system state; and data-assimilation techniques to combine the model predictions with the sensor observations. Commonly, both process and observation models are formulated in Eulerian (space–time) coordinates. However, recent studies show that (first-order) macroscopic traffic flow models can be formulated and solved more efficiently and accurately in Lagrangian (vehicle number–time) coordinates (which move with traffic stream) than in Eulerian coordinates (which are fixed in space). In this article such a Lagrangian system model for state estimation is used. The approach uses the extended Kalman filtering technique, in which the discretized Lagrangian kinematic wave model with an extension (node models) for network discontinuities is used as the process equation and the average relation between vehicle spacing and speed (the fundamental diagram) is used as the observation equation. The Lagrangian state estimator is validated and compared with its Eulerian counterpart based on ground-truth data from a microscopic simulation environment. The results demonstrate that network-wide Lagrangian state estimation is possible and provide evidence that the Lagrangian estimator outperforms the Eulerian approach."
15472450.2013.773249,"Despite its ever-increasing computing power, dynamic origin–destination (OD) estimation in congested networks remains troublesome. In previous research, we have shown that an unbiased estimation requires the calculation of the sensitivity of the link flows to all origin–destination flows, in order to incorporate the effects of congestion spillback. This is, however, computationally infeasible for large-scale networks. To overcome this issue, we propose a hierarchical approach for off-line application that decomposes the dynamic OD estimation procedure in space. The main idea is to perform a more accurate dynamic OD estimation only on subareas where there is congestion spillback. The output of this estimation is then used as input for the OD estimation on the whole network. This hierarchical approach solves many practical and theoretical limitations of traditional OD estimation methods. The main advantage is that different OD estimation method can be used for different parts of the network as necessary. This allows applying more advanced and accurate, but more time-consuming, methods only where necessary. The hierarchical approach is tested on a study network and on a real network. In both cases the proposed methodology performs better than traditional OD estimation approaches, indicating its merit."
15472450.2013.802152,"Online travel time estimation is receiving increasing attention. However, offline algorithms remain important, as databases of historical travel times are needed for many intelligent transportation systems applications. In this paper a parsimonious method is presented for estimating off-line travel times based on local speed measurements along a route with uninterrupted flow, for example, on motorways. The interpolation between the different detector locations is done by reconstructing trajectories based on traffic flow theoretical principles. The proposed method is efficient, easy to calibrate, and shows reliable results even when detector spacing is relatively high. The method is compared to other existing methods and validated on a 40-km highway."
15472450.2013.802155,"Travel times on the urban roadways are intrinsically uncertain. For known traffic conditions, a wide travel time distribution can be observed. Among all the components of travel times, delays incurred when approaching intersections constitute a large part of travel times that vehicles experience in urban trips. In this article, a model is presented for the delay distribution function for an urban trip with two fixed-time controlled intersections. Most parameters of the model are related to traffic control and flows, which can be directly calibrated from observations. The overflow queue distribution provides important parameters in the delay distribution function that have to be calibrated indirectly from traffic measurements, for example, from the measured delays and flows. Based on the directly observed and estimated model parameters, the delay distribution can be reconstructed. This article discusses the calibration procedure for delays. Two parameter estimation methods, namely, maximum likelihood (ML) and least squares (LS), are applied to estimate the overflow queue distribution from sample data simulated by VISSIM. Results show that estimation accuracy is not so susceptible to the choice of the estimation methods, sampling techniques, and sample size. The proposed delay model is able to successfully capture the delay process."
15472450.2013.801712,"This article presents a mixed-integer linear-programming formulation for integrating short-term maintenance planning in a network-wide railway rolling stock circulation problem. This is a key problem in railway rostering planning that requires covering a given set of services and maintenance works with a minimum amount of rolling stock units. In our formulation, a rostering solution is viewed as a minimal cost Hamiltonian cycle in a graph with service pairings, empty runs, and short-term maintenance tasks. We use a commercial MILP solver to compute efficient solutions in a short time. Experimental results on real-world scenarios from the main Italian railway company Trenitalia show that this integrated approach can reduce significantly the number of trains and empty runs when compared with the current rolling stock circulation plan."
15472450.2013.801714,"Railway traffic is operated according to a detailed schedule, specifying for each train its path through the network plus arrival and departure times at its scheduled stops. During daily operations, disturbances perturb the plan and dispatchers take action in order to keep operations feasible and to limit delay propagation. This article presents a thorough assessment of the possible application of an optimization-based framework for the evaluation of different timetables and proactive railway traffic management over a large network, considering stochastic disturbances. Two types of timetables are evaluated in detail: “ regular” and “ shuttle” timetables. The former is the regular plan of operations for normal traffic conditions, while the latter plan is designed to be robust against widespread disturbances, such as adverse weather, track blockage, and other operational failures. A test case is presented on a large Dutch railway network with heavy traffic, for which we compute by microsimulation detailed train movements at the level of block signals and at a precision of seconds. When comparing the timetables, a trade-off is found between the minimization of train delays, due to potential conflicts and due to delayed rolling stock and crew duties, and the minimization of passenger travel time between given origins and destinations."
15472450.2013.802160,"One of the effects of the development of air traffic during recent years has been the increase of congestion on major airports and their aprons, where ground handling operations take place. Efficiency and safety issues become important on the aprons. The “Integrated Airport Apron Safety Fleet Management—AAS” project aims at setting a decision support system for efficient and safe management of apron traffic, taking advantage of information gathered by “intelligent” vehicles equipped with on-board positioning and monitoring systems. In this project, we optimize the assignment of vehicles to apron operations. We present a mathematical formulation of the problem and sketch a fast sequential heuristic, which provides efficient assignments based on real-time data on position and status of vehicles and operations. We then discuss how the procedure can reach good trade-offs between efficiency and robustness against unpredicted, but frequent, delays occurring in real time at airports. The proposed approach has been applied to a major European airport (Berlin's Tegel), leading to efficiency improvements and reduction of expected delays due to handling operations."
15472450.2013.785327,"An integral component of (in-vehicle) navigation systems is the determination of optimal routes to the desired destination. An implicit assumption in the underlying algorithms is that people do not make mistakes when following the prescribed routes. This is, however, not always consistent with reality, especially when driving in unfamiliar environments. This article presents a first look at the possibility of mistakes when driving. This possibility is formalized in a Markov decision process. It is demonstrated that quite paradoxical situations can occur when accounting for mistakes. As the most interesting—but perhaps extreme—example, we have shown that under certain conditions, it is no longer optimal to recommend drivers to take the shortest route. Instead, a longer route (in certain cases even the longest!) becomes optimal. Numerical results are provided throughout the article to reveal the fundamental properties of this problem."
15472450.2013.801708,"Single-loop detectors are the most common sensors employed by freeway traffic management agencies. The data are used for traffic management and traveler information. Single-loop detectors can only measure flow and occupancy. Although speed is often the most useful metric, it can only be estimated at conventional single-loop detectors. Typically this estimate comes from the quotient of flow and occupancy multiplied by the fixed, assumed average effective vehicle length. This conventional approach is limited because the actual average effective vehicle length will vary from sample to sample. Many researchers have proposed alternatives to address this problem, and although many of the methods work well under normal conditions, there has been limited research into methods that yield reliable estimates under heavy truck traffic. Heavy truck flows may arise as a function of location or time of day, for example, with proximity to a trucking facility or in early mornings when the number of passenger vehicles drops, respectively. This article presents a new methodology to estimate speed from single-loop detectors in conditions where trucks comprise a large percentage of the fleet. While the focus is on single loop detectors, the work is equally applicable to side-fire microwave radar detectors that emulate single-loop detectors."
15472450.2013.801711,"Advanced traffic management systems rely heavily on technology to perform accurate estimations of the current state of the traffic as well as its short-term evolution. The objectives are improving traffic flow and enhancing road safety. Their success is based on accurate monitoring of two key variables, specifically speed and occupancy. The latter of the two has, to date, received significantly less attention from the scientific community. In this work we present a lightweight method to perform “on-line” occupancy estimation. We first propose three occupancy measurements calculated from data collected by a floating car: vehicle count, percentage of stop time, and headway. We then extend these discrete values to a continuous estimation of occupancy in space and time. The proposed estimators are based on a pairwise linear regression of each of the previously calculated measurements over certain references obtained from other floating cars or magnetic loop detectors. The method has been calibrated and validated under real traffic conditions and data. Despite the ease of implementation, the method is able to reproduce the occupancy values generated by the actual loop detectors, achieving promising results, with estimation errors down to 6.52%, even before multivehicle systems are considered."
15472450.2013.802151,"To ensure the effective operation of traffic signal systems, different signal timings should be designed to accommodate traffic pattern variations. One of the greatest challenges is the identification of appropriate time-of-day (TOD) breakpoints, where different signal timings could be implemented during the time periods between two consecutive breakpoints. This research presents an advanced cluster analysis aimed at identifying TOD breakpoints for coordinated, semiactuated modes when it is necessary for multiple intersection operations to be considered simultaneously. Different from previous studies, this proposed methodology considers the time of traffic occurring as one dimension in clustering and uses continuous traffic data obtained through innovative, nonintrusive data collection techniques, which significantly improve this method's performance. The operability of this proposed method is demonstrated in a case study of a corridor located in Tampa, FL. The traffic simulation results reported in this article reveal that this novel procedure performs better than existing TOD signal timing plans."
15472450.2013.806851,"This study investigates the time-dependent reliable shortest path problem (TD-RSPP), which is commonly encountered in congested urban road networks. Two variants of TD-RSPP are considered in this study. The first variant is to determine the earliest arrival time and associated reliable shortest path for a given departure time, referred to as the “forward” TD-RSPP. The second problem is to determine the latest departure time and associated reliable shortest path for a given preferred arrival time, referred as the “backward” TD-RSPP. It is shown in this article that TD-RSPP is not reversible. The backward TD-RSPP cannot be solved by the algorithms designed for the forward problem using the reverse search from destination to origin. In this study, two efficient solution algorithms are proposed to solve the forward and backward TD-RSPP exactly and the optimality of proposed algorithms is rigorously proved. The proposed solution algorithms have potential applications in both advanced traveler information systems and stochastic dynamic traffic assignment models."
15472450.2013.806858,"In this study, we explored the potential of using electronic toll collection (ETC)-derived data that are a part of intelligent transport systems (ITS). Dynamic origin–destination (OD) traffic volumes were estimated using ETC data on the Hanshin Expressway. A dynamic OD estimation model that was suggested in a previous study was used, and abundant ETC data were input to improve the estimation accuracy. The results of OD estimation were analyzed to understand traffic demand and its variation. External factors were clarified that have an influence on variances in the OD flows, and statistical analysis methods for the variations were proposed depending on the factors. Moreover, the improvements in traffic simulation accuracy and performance as a result of using ETC data as input variables in the simulation models were discussed. According to the results of this study, ETC data have potential to assist in understaningd traffic demand and its variation, and the results can be applied to network management."
15472450.2013.806854,"This article describes the first application of a novel path flow and origin/destination (OD) matrix estimator for iterated dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) microsimulations. The presented approach, which operates on a trip-based demand representation, is derived from an agent-based DTA calibration methodology that relies on an activity-based demand model (Flötteröd, Bierlaire, & Nagel, 2011). The objective of this work is to demonstrate the transferability of the agent-based approach to the more widely used OD matrix-based demand representation. The calibration (i) operates at the same disaggregate level as the microsimulation and (ii) has drastic computational advantages over conventional OD matrix estimators in that the demand adjustments are conducted within the iterative loop of the DTA microsimulation, which results in a running time of the calibration that is in the same order of magnitude as a plain simulation. We describe an application of this methodology to the trip-based DRACULA microsimulation and present an illustrative example that clarifies its capabilities."
15472450.2013.806847,"This study focuses on the possibility that providing travelers with information on travel time distribution, along with the existing travel time information, might affect their decision making and enhance traffic control. As an initial step to confirm the effectiveness of travel time distribution information, we use a laboratory experiment to obtain panel data of route choices when information is provided. The rationality of the behavior of the respondents and the characteristics of the route choice are first analyzed by aggregation analysis and then statistically examined by specifying a mixed logit route choice model. As a result, it is revealed that both travel time information and maximum travel time information significantly affect route choice behavior when a penalty is imposed for late arrival."

We first develop a set of heuristic rules to automatically filter out abnormal samples from a massive trajectory data set and identify DLC trajectories from a mixture of mandatory lane change (MLC) and DLC trajectories. Then, we investigate a variety of DLC characteristics. We demonstrate that the kernel part of every normal DLC trajectory can be approximately depicted by a certain fifth-order polynomial. Moreover, we discuss the definition of begin/end points of DLC actions and show that the duration time of DLC actions follows a log-normal distribution with respect to navigation speed. All the findings can help promote temporal and spatial accuracy of lane changing models."
15472450.2013.824757,"Freeway incidents not only threaten travelers’ safety but also cause severe congestion. Incident-induced delay (IID) refers to the extra travel delay resulting from incidents on top of the recurrent congestion. Quantifying IID would help people better understand the real cost of incidents, maximize the benefit-cost ratio of investment on incident remedy actions, and develop active traffic management and integrated corridor management strategies. By combining a modified queuing diagram and short-term traffic flow forecasting techniques, this study proposes an approach to estimate the temporal IID for a roadway section, given that the incidents occurs between two traffic flow detectors. The approach separates IID from the total travel delay, estimates IID for each individual incident, and only takes volume as input for IID quantification, avoiding using speed data that are widely involved in previous algorithms yet are less available or prone to poor data quality. Therefore, this approach can be easily deployed to broader ranges where only volume data are available. To verify its estimation accuracy, this study captures two incident videos and extracts ground-truth IID data, which is rarely done by previous studies. The verification shows that the IID estimation errors of the proposed approach are within 6% for both cases. The approach has been implemented in a Web-based system, which enables quick, convenient, and reliable freeway IID estimation in the Puget Sound region in the state of Washington."
15472450.2013.824762,"Traditionally, traffic monitoring requires data from traffic cameras, loop detectors, or probe vehicles that are usually operated by dedicated employees. In efforts to reduce the capital and operational costs associated with traffic monitoring, departments of transportation have explored the feasibility of using global positioning system (GPS) data loggers on their probe vehicles that are postprocessed for analyzing the traffic patterns on desired routes. Furthermore, most cell phones are equipped with embedded assisted-GPS (AGPS) chips, and if the mode of transportation the phone is in can be anonymously identified, the phones can be treated as if they are probe vehicles that are voluntarily hovering throughout the city, at minimal additional costs. Emerging cell phones known as “smartphones” are equipped with additional sensors including an accelerometer and magnetometer. The accelerometer can directly measure the acceleration values, as opposed to having acceleration values derived from speed values in conventional GPS sensors. The magnetometer can measure mode-specific electromagnetic levels. Smartphones are subscribed with roadside Internet data plans that can provide an essential platform for real-time traffic monitoring. In this article, neural network-based artificial intelligence is used to identify the mode of transportation by detecting the patterns of distinct physical profile of each mode that consists of speed, acceleration, number of satellites in view, and electromagnetic levels. Results show that newly available values in smartphones improve the mode detection rates when compared with using conventional GPS data loggers. When smartphones are in known orientations, they can provide three-dimensional (3-D) acceleration values that can further improve mode detection accuracies."
15472450.2013.824763,"In most metropolitan areas, an emergency evacuation may require a potentially large number of pedestrians to walk some distance to access their passenger cars or resort to transit systems. In this process, the massive number of pedestrians may place a tremendous burden on vehicles in the roadway network, especially at critical intersections. Thus, the effective road enforcement of the vehicle and pedestrian flows and the proper coordination between these two flows at critical intersections during a multimodal evacuation process is a critical issue in evacuation planning. This article presents an integrated linear model for the design of optimized flow plans for massive mixed pedestrian–vehicle flows within an evacuation zone. The optimized flow can also be used to generate signal timing plans at critical intersections. In addition, the linear nature of the model can circumvent the computational burden to apply in large-scale networks. An illustrating example of the evacuation around the M&T Bank Stadium in downtown Baltimore, MD, is presented and used to demonstrate the model's capability to address the complex interactions between vehicle and pedestrian flows within an evacuation zone. Results of simulation experiments verify the applicability of our model to a real-world scenario and further indicate that accounting for such conflicting movements will yield more reliable estimation of an evacuation's required clearance time."

Commonly requested routes (i.e., shortest or fastest) may include areas with poor GNSS QoS, which can subsequently degrade navigation performance. To provide alternative routes with high or acceptable GNSS QoS along a route, a novel optimal routing for navigation systems/services based on GNSS QoS by utilizing integrated GNSS (iGNSS) QoS prediction is presented in this article. New routing criteria based on GNSS QoS are maximum availability, maximum accuracy, maximum continuity, and maximum reliability. Two experiments were conducted to compare GNSS QoS-based routes against shortest routes. In one experiment, routes were simulated, and in another, generated routes based on GNSS QoS were evaluated against GPS-based trajectories as ground truths. The results show that GNSS QoS-based routes provide routes with higher QoS, more than 50%, and longer, about 50%, than shortest routes."

The classical systems in Europe are organized in stations scattered around the city where a person may pick up a vehicle and afterward return it to the same station (round trip). Allowing a person to drop off the vehicle at any station, called one-way system, poses a significant logistics problem because it creates a significant stock imbalance at the stations, which means that there will be times when users will not have a vehicle available for their trip. Previous mathematical programming formulations have tried to overcome this limitation by optimizing trip selection and station location in a city in order to capture the best trips for balancing the system. But there was one main limitation: The users were assumed to be inflexible with respect to their choice of a station, and held to use only the one closest to their origin and destination. If the user is willing to use the second or even the third closest station the user could benefit from using real-time information on vehicle stocks at each station and be able to select the one with available capacity. In this article we extend a previous model for trip selection and station location that takes that aspect into account by considering more vehicle pick-up and drop-off station options and then apply it to a trip origin–destination matrix from the Lisbon region in Portugal. Through the extended formulation we were able to conclude that user flexibility allied with having information on vehicle stocks increases the profit of the company, as people will go directly to a station with a vehicle available, thus making the use of the fleet more efficient. Observing the size of the stations resulting from the model, we also concluded that the effect of information is enhanced by large car-sharing systems consisting of many small stations."
15472450.2013.836929,"This research proposes a short-term highway traffic state prediction method based on a structural state space model, with the intention to provide a robust approach for obtaining accurate forecasts of traffic state under both recurring and non-recurring conditions. True traffic state is decomposed to three components, namely, regular traffic pattern, structural deviation, and random fluctuation. Particularly, the structural deviation term reflects the change of true traffic state from regular (historical) pattern, due to unexpected capacity reduction and/or demand variations. A polynomial trend is adopted to describe the temporal evolution of structural deviations across different time intervals. We derive an analytical form of structural deviations in a single bottleneck case based on cumulative flow count diagrams. The proposed model is incorporated in a Kalman filtering-based algorithmic framework, together with an adaptive scheme for determining the variances of random errors. A set of numerical experiments was conducted on two test beds in the northern Taiwan highway network. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is particularly superior to an ordinary Kalman filtering method presented in the literature under non-recurring conditions, highlighting the advantage of combining both the polynomial trend model and historical pattern into the proposed short-term traffic state prediction approach."
15472450.2013.806846,"Several transportation problems, such as implementation of truck-only lanes, require understanding the interaction of heterogeneous dynamic traffic flows in order to provide accurate solutions. System-optimal dynamic traffic assignment can be modeled using a network loading procedure based on the cell transmission model, that is, the hydrodynamic wave model, and solved by linear programming. However, this framework cannot handle the asymmetric integration between the flow of trucks and cars. This article presents a novel formulation for network loading in system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment considering car–truck interactions. By using an embedded cell transmission model, this formulation incorporates a set of assumptions related to the kinematic characteristics of the flow of cars, trucks, and their interactions that can be solved using linear programming. We present numerical results supporting our modeling assumptions. Likewise, the observed emergent behavior captures the car–truck interactions accurately and indicates that minimum system-optimal travel time is obtained by encouraging cars to use highways with shorter distances."
15472450.2013.806753,"Within the simulation-based dynamic traffic assignment (SBDTA) model, the time-dependent shortest path (TDSP) algorithm plays a crucial role in the path-set update procedure by solving for the current optimal auxiliary solution (shortest path). Common types of TDSP algorithms require temporal discretization of link/node time/cost data, and the discretization could affect the solution quality of TDSP and of the overall SBDTA as well. This article introduces two variable time-discretization strategies applicable to TDSP algorithms. The strategies are aimed at determining the optimal time discretization for time-dependent links/nodes travel time data. The first proposed strategy produces a specific discretization interval for each link. The second proposed strategy generates time-varying intervals for the same link over the analysis period. The proposed strategies are implemented in a link-based time-dependent A* algorithm in a SBDTA model DynusT and tested with two numerical experiments on two traffic networks. The results show that the proposed discretization methods achieve the research goal—to flexibly and scalably balance the memory usage and run time for SBDTA without degrading the convergence. This property is rather important when dealing with a large real-world network with a long analysis period."
15472450.2013.806764,"In this study, a novel method is proposed to predict the traffic features in a long freeway corridor with a number of time steps ahead. The proposed method, on the basis of rolling self-structured traffic patterns, utilizes the growing hierarchical self-organizing map model to partition the unlabeled traffic patterns into an appropriate number of clusters and then develops the genetic programming model for each cluster to predict its corresponding traffic features. For demonstration, the proposed method is tested against a 110-km freeway stretch, on which 48 time steps of 5-min traffic flows are predicted (i.e., a 4-h prediction). The prediction accuracy of the proposed method is compared with other models (ARIMA, SARIMA, and naive models) and the results support the superiority of the proposed method. Further analyses indicate that applications of the proposed method to larger scale freeway networks require sufficient lengths of observation to acquire enough traffic patterns for training and validation in order to achieve higher prediction accuracy."
15472450.2013.806844,"Traffic congestion has become a major challenge in recent years in many countries of the world. One way to alleviate congestion is to manage the traffic efficiently by applying intelligent transportation systems (ITS). One set of ITS technologies helps in diverting vehicles from congested parts of the network to alternate routes having less congestion. Congestion is often measured by traffic density, which is the number of vehicles per unit stretch of the roadway. Density, being a spatial characteristic, is difficult to measure in the field. Also, the general approach of estimating density from location-based measures may not capture the spatial variation in density. To capture the spatial variation better, density can be estimated using both location-based and spatial data sources using a data fusion approach. The present study uses a Kalman filter to fuse spatial and location-based data for the estimation of traffic density. Subsequently, the estimated data are utilized for predicting density to future time intervals using a time-series regression model. The models were estimated and validated using both field and simulated data. Both estimation and prediction models performed well, despite the challenges arising from heterogeneous traffic flow conditions prevalent in India."
15472450.2013.806745,"In conventional transportation planning models, it was always assumed that the population density is given and fixed in the study areas. Therefore, the effects of population density on travel choice have not been explicitly incorporated into these existing models for long-term transportation planning. Meanwhile, travel choice models in previous studies are usually developed by using discrete choice theories or user equilibrium principle. Thus, many significant characteristics of travelers’ behaviors, such as risk preference and learning process over time, cannot be considered in these conventional models. This article proposes a convex prospect theory-based model to investigate the effects of population density on the travelers’ mode-choice behavior under an advanced transportation information system (ATIS) in a multimodal transportation corridor. It is shown that population density is closely co-related to the modal split results and dependent on the performance of the railway mode in the study corridor. The park-and-ride mode may not be suitable for areas with high population density. This article also investigates the travelers’ reference points on the generalized travel costs by modes. A numerical example is given to illustrate the properties of the proposed model together with some insightful findings."
15472450.2013.806761,"This article proposes a maximum-likelihood method to update travel behavior model parameters and estimate vehicle trip chain based on plate scanning. The information from plate scanning consists of the vehicle passing time and sequence of scanned vehicles along a series of plate scanning locations (sensor locations installed on road network). The article adopts the hierarchical travel behavior decision model, in which the upper tier is an activity pattern generation model, and the lower tier is a destination and route choice model. The activity pattern is an individual profile of daily performed activities. To obtain reliable estimation results, the sensor location schemes for predicting trip chaining are proposed. The maximum-likelihood estimation problem based on plate scanning is formulated to update model parameters. This problem is solved by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. The model and algorithm are then tested with simulated plate scanning data in a modified Sioux Falls network. The results illustrate the efficiency of the model and its potential for an application to large and complex network cases."
15472450.2013.806736,"Traditional or standard work schedules refer to the requirement that workers must be at work the same days and during the same hours each day. This requirement constrains work-related trip arrivals, and generates morning and afternoon peak hours due to the concentration of work days and/or work hours. Alternative work schedules seek to reschedule work activities away from this traditional requirement. The aim is to flatten the peak hours by spreading the demand (i.e., assigning it to the shoulders of the peak hour), lowering the peak demand. This not only would reduce societal costs but also can help to minimize the physical requirements. In this article, a two-stage optimization model is presented to quantify the effects of staggered work hours under incentive policies. In the first stage, a variation of the generalized quadratic assignment problem is used to represent the firm’s assignment of workers to different work starting times. This is the input of a nonlinear complementarity problem that captures the behavior of the users of the transportation network who are seeking to overcome the constraints imposed by working schedules (arrival times). Two examples are provided to show how the model can be used to (a) quantify the effects and response of the firm to external incentives and (b) evaluate what type of arrangements in starting times are to be made in order to achieve a social optimum."
15472450.2013.806843,"Non-recurrent congestion or incidents are detrimental to the operability and efficiency of busy urban transport networks. There exist multiple automatic incident detection algorithms (AIDAs) to remotely detect the occurrence of an incident in highway or freeway scenarios; however, very little research has been performed to automatically detect incidents in signalized urban arterials. This limited research attention has mostly been focused on developing new urban arterial specific algorithms, rather than identifying alternative methods to synthesize existing freeway-based algorithms for urban conditions. The main hindrance to such synthesis is that the traffic patterns on the signalized urban arterials are significantly different from the same on highways/freeways due to the presence of traffic intersections. This article introduces a new strategy of customizing the existing AIDAs (freeway based or otherwise) to significantly improve their adaptability to signalized urban arterial transport networks. The new strategy focuses on preprocessing the traffic information before being used as input to a freeway/highway-based AIDA to lessen the effect of traffic signals and to imitate the input patterns in highway/freeway-based incident conditions. The effectiveness of this new strategy has been established with the help of four existing AIDAs. The proposed strategy is a simple solution to implement existing algorithms to signalized urban networks without any further instrumentation or operational cost."
15472450.2014.889953,"We suggest an efficient polynomial algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows based on agent negotiation. A generic agent decomposition of the problem is introduced featuring a clear separation between the local planning performed by the individual vehicles and the abstract global coordination achieved by negotiation—differentiating the presented algorithm from the classical centralized algorithms. The semantic of the abstract negotiation process is discussed, as well as the two alternative local planning strategies used by the individual vehicles. A relevant comparison to the state-of-the-art classical and agent-based algorithms is provided, missing from most previous agent-based studies. The algorithm performs slightly worse than the state-of-the-art classical algorithms but improves on all the previous comparable agent-based algorithms."
15472450.2014.889960,"Traditionally, vehicles have been considered as machines that are controlled by humans for the purpose of transportation. A more modern view is to envision drivers and passengers as actively interacting with a complex automated system. Such interactive activity leads us to consider intelligent and advanced ways of interaction leading to cars that can adapt to their drivers. In this article, we focus on the adaptive cruise control (ACC) technology that allows a vehicle to automatically adjust its speed to maintain a preset distance from the vehicle in front of it based on the driver’s preferences. Although individual drivers have different driving styles and preferences, current systems do not distinguish among users. We introduce an approach to combine machine learning algorithms with demographic information and behavioral driver models into existing automated assistive systems. This approach can reduce the interactions between drivers and automated systems by adjusting parameters relevant to the operation of these systems based on their specific drivers and context of drive. We also learn when users tend to engage and disengage the automated system. This approach sheds light on the kinds of dynamics that users develop while interacting with automation and can teach us how to improve these systems for the benefit of their users. While generic packages such as Weka were successful in learning drivers’ behavior exclusively based on the ACC’s sensors, we found that improved learning models could be developed by adding information on drivers’ demographics and a previously developed model about different driver types. We present the general methodology of our learning procedure and suggest applications of our approach to other domains as well."
15472450.2013.856718,"Pedestrian simulation is a consolidated area of application in which agent-based models are often employed; successful case studies are described in the literature and commercial, off-the-shelf simulators are commonly employed by decision makers and consultancy companies. Most state-of-the-art models, however, generally do not consider the explicit representation of pedestrians aggregations (groups) and their implications on the overall system dynamics. This work is aimed at discussing the relevance and significance of this research effort with respect to the need of empirical data about the implication of the presence of groups of pedestrians in different situations (e.g., changing density, spatial configurations of the environment). The article describes an agent-based model encompassing both traditional individual motivations (i.e., tendency to stay away from other pedestrians while moving toward the goal) and a simplified mechanism considering the cohesion effects related to the presence of groups in the crowd. The model is tested in a simple scenario to evaluate the implications of some modeling choices and the presence of groups in the simulated scenario. Moreover, the model is applied in a real-world scenario characterized by the presence of organized groups as an instrument for crowd management. Results are discussed and compared to experimental observations and to data available in the literature."
15472450.2014.889964,"Current state-of-the-art highway traffic flow simulators rely extensively on models using formulas similar to those describing physical phenomena, such as forces, viscosity, or potential fields. These models have been carefully calibrated to represent the overall flow of traffic and they can also be extended to account for the cognitive limitations of the driver, such as reaction times. However, there are some aspects of driver behavior, such as strategic planning, that are difficult to formulate mathematically. In this article, we describe the YAES-DSIM highway simulator, which integrates virtual physics models with an agent-based model. The virtual physics component models the physical vehicle and the subconscious aspects of the driver behavior, while the agent component is responsible for the strategic and tactical decisions, which are difficult to model using virtual physics. We focus on the lane change decisions of the drivers, with special attention to the optimal lane positioning for a safe exit. We have used the model to simulate the flow of traffic on Highway 408 in Orlando, Florida, and to study the impact of various tactical and strategic decisions on the efficiency and safety of the traffic."
15472450.2013.856721,"Data on traffic accidents clearly point to road black spots, where the accident rate is always high. However, road safety research is still far from understanding why these particular places on a road are risky. The reason is the lack of sufficient knowledge on how pedestrians and drivers interact when facing a potentially dangerous traffic situation, and the lack of an integrated framework that relates the data on human behavior to real-world traffic situations. We attempt to tackle this problem by developing SAFEPED, a multi-agent microscopic three-dimensional (3D) simulation of vehicle and pedestrian dynamics at a black spot. SAFEPED is a test platform for evaluating experimentally estimated drivers’ and pedestrians’ behavioral rules, and estimating accident risks in different traffic situations. It aims to analyze the design of existing and future black spots and to assess alternative architectural and environmental solutions in order to identify maximally efficient safety countermeasures."
15472450.2014.941758,"Traffic routing is a well-established optimization problem in traffic management. Here, we address dynamic routing problems where the load of roads is taken into account dynamically, aiming at the optimization of required travel times. We investigate ant-based algorithms that can handle dynamic routing problems, but suffer from negative emergent effects like road congestions. These negative effects are inherent in the design of ant-based algorithms. In this article we propose an inverse ant-based routing algorithm to (a) maintain the positive features of ant-based algorithms for dynamic routing problems, while (b) avoiding the occurrence of negative emerging effects, like road congestion. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing its results with two alternative routing algorithms, namely, A*, which is a static routing algorithm, and an iterative approach. In particular, the iterative approach is used for providing an upper bound, as it uses routing knowledge in a number of calibration runs, to determine the actual load, before the effective routing is done. For the evaluation we used the agent-based traffic simulation system MAINSIM. The evaluation was done with one synthetic and two real-world scenarios, to outline the practical relevance of our findings. Based on these evaluations, we can conclude that the inverse ant-based routing approach is particularly suited for a scenario with a high traffic density, as it can adapt the routing of each vehicle, while avoiding the negative emerging effects of conventional ant-based routing algorithms."
15472450.2014.941759,"Ridesharing, that is, the problem of finding parts of routes that can be shared by several travelers with different points of departure and destinations, is a complex, multiagent decision-making problem. The problem has been widely studied but only for the case of ridesharing using freely moving vehicles not bound to fixed routes and/or schedules—ridesharing on timetabled public transport services has not been previously considered. In this article, we address this problem and propose a solution employing strategic multiagent planning that guarantees that for any shared journey plan found, each individual is better off taking the shared ride rather than traveling alone, thus providing a clear incentive to participate in it. We evaluate the proposed solution on real-world scenarios in terms of the algorithm’s scalability and the ability to address the inherent trade-off between cost savings and the prolongation of journey duration. The results show that under a wide range of circumstances our algorithm finds attractive shared journey plans. In addition to serving as a basis for traveler-oriented ridesharing service, our system allows stakeholders to determine appropriate pricing policies to incentivize group travel and to predict the effects of potential service changes."
15472450.2013.856714,"We describe the design and evaluation of a system named Quantified Traveler (QT). QT is a computational travel feedback system. Travel feedback is an established programmatic method whereby travelers record travel in diaries, and meet with a counselor who guides the user to alternate mode or trip decisions that are more sustainable or otherwise beneficial to society, while still meeting the subject's mobility needs. QT is a computation surrogate for the counselor. Since counselor costs can limit the size of travel feedback programs, a system such as QT at the low costs of cloud computing could dramatically increase scale, and thereby sustainable travel. QT uses an application (app) on the phone to collect travel data, a server in the cloud to process it into travel diaries, and then a personalized carbon, exercise, time, and cost footprint. The subject is able to see all of this information on the Web. We evaluate the system with 135 subjects to learn whether subjects will let us use their personal phones and data plans to build travel diaries, whether they actually use the website to look at their travel information, whether the design creates pro-environmental shifts in psychological variables measured by entry and exit surveys, and finally whether the revealed travel behavior records reduced driving. Before-and-after statistical analysis and the results from a structural equation model suggest that the results are a qualified success."
15472450.2015.1012865,"In this study the impact of real-time travel information acquired through mobile devices on traveler behavior is investigated. The study takes into consideration individuals’ attitudes toward the use of smart mobile devices. The effect of traffic information acquisition in activity rescheduling is also considered. A case study was developed for the Athens Metropolitan Area, Greece, in 2009. A survey was conducted that included both revealed and stated preference data, as well as attitudes and perceptions of individual decision makers. This article focuses on the modeling and analysis of the stated preferences experiment conducted. An integrated error component latent variable model was estimated, predicting the probability of travelers’ switching behavior as a function of travel information and traffic information seekers through mobile devices. The analysis of the results indicates that traffic information seekers through mobile devices are more likely to switch travel behavior, while traffic information appears to affect the rescheduling of individuals' activities that in many cases is also accompanied by mode or route switching."

This method synthesizes multiple kinds of data from smartphone sensors, which provide relevant location or transport mode information: global positioning system (GPS), Bluetooth, and accelerometer. The method is based on a smartphone measurement model that calculates the likelihood of observing the smartphone data in the multimodal transport network. The output of this probabilistic method is a set of candidate true paths and the probability of each path being the true one. The transport mode used on each arc is also inferred. Numerical experiments include map visualizations of some example trips and an analysis on the performance of the transport mode inference."
15472450.2013.856712,"In this article an application for mobile navigation is introduced with the intention to serve users who either do not have access to a private vehicle or prefer combining a vehicle with a public transport mode provided that it yields a reduction to their total travel time. This application guides users to their destination by integrating the use of private and public transport and differs from in-vehicle route guidance systems that suggest routes only for private vehicle users, and from other conventional mobile route guidance systems that propose either a route for public transport users or a route for private vehicle users. In addition, the proposed application suggests intermodal routes that comply with each individual's preferences in an attempt to fulfill the user's needs in complex, urban networks. The data requirements for the mobile application are covered by a real-time database that is handled by a central server (processor) and contains information about traffic congestion, train and bus schedules, and more. Finally, two algorithms are presented in order to serve the computational part of the application and determine optimal paths in intermodal networks with respect to a predetermined set of users’ preferences. The data requirements, the structure and the architecture of the application, the required technologies, the underpinning mathematical context of the proposed algorithms, and the performance of this application in random networks are also presented."
15472450.2014.936284,"The emergence of location-based services has raised privacy to a hot-issue status. Clearly, there is a trade-off that needs to be considered. On the one hand, additional information can arguably improve the quality of the various services, not only for the individual, but also for the entire system. On the other hand, the collection of this additional information can be considered by some as a violation of their privacy. The objective of this article is twofold: on the one hand to provide a way to quantify the value of this privacy (loss), and on the other hand to present results from a case study applying this methodology. The methodology is generic and is based on the concept of the marginal rate of substitution between cost and a different variable (in this case privacy). The application is based on a stated-preference questionnaire that was specifically designed for this application and disseminated to respondents in Athens, Greece. An ordered probit model, in which all variables are interacted with the main service attributes (cost, accuracy, and privacy), is estimated based on this data. The empirical distribution of estimated willingness-to-accept for giving up part of the privacy (their current location and destination) was also calculated. The mean of the value of privacy (amount needed to give up one level of privacy) is found to be equal to 3.87€, while the median is equal to 2.50€ (reflecting the skewness of the distribution). This amount is considered reasonable since such services are commercially available for US$5 per month."
15472450.2014.977043,"A common method of the dilemma zone (DZ) protection at intersections is to hold the green until the number of vehicles in DZ is lower than a threshold. Since the threshold is typically empirical and fixed, it cannot accommodate the dynamic and time-varying traffic patterns and therefore should be adjusted regularly. This article presents a new Markov-process-based DZ protection algorithm, which considers the number of vehicles in DZ (i.e., the state) over time to be a Markov process. At each time step, the algorithm first predicts the future states with the Markov state-transit matrix, then compares them with the current state to determine whether to end the green or not. In this way, the new end-green criterion is not the fixed threshold value but the current state and the prediction with the Markov state-transit matrix. Meanwhile, the Markov matrix is automatically updated whenever the new observed detected state transitions come in. The new algorithms were also evaluated in simulation and the simulation results showed that the new algorithm maintains reliable and effective protection in a dynamic traffic environment. At last, we find that the new algorithm performance can be further improved if the vehicle trajectories are precisely measured rather than estimated."
15472450.2014.977049,"Incidents cause substantial travel delays on urban freeways. Travel delays due to incidents are typically estimated for each incident independently. However, when multiple incidents occur on the same stretch of a roadway, treating them independently and ignoring their interactions leads to inaccurate results, which ultimately may lead to inefficient incident management strategies. This study examines delays due to primary–secondary incident pairs that occur on the same stretch of a freeway within a short time gap. Depending on their correlation in time and space, they can have varying degrees of impacts on the traffic flow. This article assesses the total delays induced by primary–secondary incident pairs by jointly modeling their occurrences. First, incident data combined with roadway inventory data from Hampton Roads, Virginia, are analyzed to understand the attributes of primary–secondary incident pairs, e.g., durations, lane blockages, and time gaps (between start times of the primary and its secondary incidents). Then using microscopic simulation as a primary evaluation tool, the effects of three critical parameters are investigated: time gap, distance between primary and secondary incidents, and traffic demand level. The historical incident analysis shows that, on average, primary–secondary incident pairs have substantially longer durations than single incidents. The joint analysis of queuing delays induced by primary incident and its secondary incident suggests that time gap and distance between a primary incident and its secondary incident are significantly associated with the total delays after controlling for other factors (e.g., the two associated incidents’ durations and lane blockages). Furthermore, based on the scenarios tested (i.e., two incidents both blocking the right lane in a three-lane basic freeway section), it is found that the sum of delays induced by a primary incident and its secondary incident separately will over- or underestimate the actual delays. For those secondary incidents that end after their associated primary incidents, total delays increase as time gap increases; increasing the distance between primary and secondary incidents is associated with reduction in delays. Other results and the implications of the findings for traffic operations are presented in the article."
15472450.2014.977046,"Urban expressways play an important role in urban road networks. Although automatic incident detection (AID) methods have been studied for a long time, most of the existing AID algorithms are designed for freeways and do not explicitly consider the detection of incidents near ramps with frequent in and out weaving flows. Urban expressways usually have short spaced ramps, which makes the traffic flow characterizations quite different from the ones of freeways. In addition, expressways usually have heavy traffic flow, which makes it more difficult to distinguish incidents from congestion. This article presents an AID method for urban expressways, using loop detector data. Based on the geometric conditions and detector locations, the expressway is divided into short segments. The equivalent upstream and downstream traffic flow density difference is defined and calculated using the loop detector data. A detection logic based on the pattern of the density difference fluctuation is then proposed. The performance of the proposed algorithm was tested using real incident data from a corridor of the Shanghai expressway and compared with two classic AID algorithms. The results indicate that this method performs very well and is suitable for urban expressways."
15472450.2013.836930,"Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) play an important role in public transit. This study addresses modeling and algorithm for the optimal single-depot vehicle scheduling problem (SDVSP) in the intelligent public transit operation, which has been implemented successfully in practice. The problem is formulated as a fixed-interval scheduling model in accord with job shop scheduling theory, which aims to assign ideal jobs to machines at appropriate times to maximize production in computer science or industrial engineering. This model allows transportation engineers to make use of those out-of-the-box theories and solution methods already developed for fixed-interval scheduling problems. In this article, the SDVSP with multiple vehicle types is established as a non-preemptive online multiprocessor-task fixed-interval scheduling model. As conventional solution methods for solving fixed interval scheduling problems are no longer available for the proposed model, this article develops the algorithm based on the FIFO (first in, first out) rule to find the optimal vehicle scheduling solution, and the optimal criterion is proved via competitive analysis. A case study is carried out to evaluate the proposed methodology by using field data collected from one transit system."
15472450.2013.856724,"The perception and the interpretation of the vehicle's surrounding are the core modules in any advanced driving assistance system, and the first two stages of every autonomous driving solution. The purpose of the perception stage is to assess the state of the relevant objects (objects’ positions, shape, class, orientation, speed) using the primary sensorial information. The purpose of the interpretation stage is to use the objects assessment in order to achieve situation assessment, that is, identification of the instantaneous relations between the traffic environment elements as well as their evolution in time. The work presented in this article lies within the interpretation layer; our aim is to identify on which of the road's lanes is the ego-vehicle currently traveling. We refer to the own vehicle as the ego-vehicle and to its current driving lane as the ego-lane. The ego-vehicle is equipped with a stereovision perception system, and the proposed solution is to identify the ego-lane number by matching the visually detected lane landmarks with the corresponding map landmarks, available from an original extended digital map. Additionally, the visually detected vehicles are used for ego-lane number identification. The proposed solution is a probabilistic one, in the form of a Bayesian network, which uses as evidence the visual cues provided by the stereovision perception system. In order to incorporate the dynamic nature of the problem, a temporal dimension was added to the network, resulting in a dynamic Bayesian model. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method in complex situations, and the improved efficiency of the dynamic approach over the static one."
15472450.2013.856727,"A unique Bluetooth-enabled device may be detected several times or not at all when it passes a sensor location. This depends mainly on the strength and speed of a transmitting device, discovery procedure, location of the device relative to the Bluetooth sensor, the Bluetooth sensor's ping cycle (0.1 s), the size and shape of the sensor's detection zone, and the time span for which the Bluetooth-enabled device is within the detection zone. The influences of size of Bluetooth sensor detection zones and Bluetooth discovery procedure on multiple detection events have been mentioned in previous research. However, their corresponding impacts on accuracy and reliability of estimated travel time have not been evaluated. In this study, a controlled field experiment is conducted to collect both Bluetooth and global positioning system (GPS) data for 1000 trips to be used as the basis for evaluation. Data obtained by GPS logger are used to calculate actual travel time, referred to as ground truth, and to geo-code the Bluetooth detection events. In this setting, reliability is defined as the percentage of devices captured per trip during the experiment. It is found that, on average, Bluetooth-enabled devices will be detected 80% of the time while passing a sensor location. The impact of location ambiguity caused by the size of the detection zone is evaluated using geo-coded Bluetooth data. Results show that more than 80% of the detection events are recorded within the range of 100 m from the sensor center line. It is also shown that short-range antennas detect Bluetooth-enabled devices in a location closer to the sensor, thus providing a more accurate travel time estimate. However, the smaller the size of the detection zone, the lower is the penetration rate, which could itself influence the accuracy of estimates. Therefore, there has to be a trade-off between acceptable level of location ambiguity and penetration rate for configuration and coverage of the antennas."
15472450.2013.857197,"This article presents methods to estimate the location of a vehicle in the queue based on the vehicle's travel time traversing a signalized intersection. The methods focus on the queue discharging process, and calculate the location (in the queue) and acceleration rate of the vehicle simultaneously using kinematic equations. If such location information can be calculated for multiple sampled vehicles in a cycle, the dynamic profile of queue length of the cycle can be estimated. By using travel times, the methods can be applied to data collected via many newly emerged traffic data collection systems such as mobile sensors. The proposed methods are tested using data from simulation, a field experiment, and the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), and are compared with a previously developed queue length method."
15472450.2014.892380,"The absence of traffic surveillance infrastructure, in many developing countries, hinders any efforts for dealing with the daily witnessed traffic chaos. The use of the cellular phone (CP) network data for traffic data collection is a promising option for large-scale coverage, given a high CP penetration rate. This article presents a bilevel procedure for the extraction of classified vehicular traffic counts for different vehicle types, in a given roadway segment, for intercity travel. The bilevel procedure operates in an offline setting, independent from any secondary traffic surveillance system. At the first level, cellular phones on board the same vehicle are clustered using a “data swarm clustering” algorithm. At the second level, a genetic fuzzy classifier (GFC) is used for vehicles classification. The development and testing of the proposed procedure was conducted using a traffic/CP simulation platform. At the development phase, the swarm-based clustering algorithm achieved 93% clustering accuracy (vehicle count accuracy). At the second level, the fuzzy classifier successfully classified around 85% of the vehicles. The procedure was further evaluated using a microsimulation model of a major travel corridor in the Greater Cairo Region, Egypt. Superior performance was achieved, at the clustering level, with an accuracy of 97.6%. The revealed accuracy demonstrates the efficiency of the developed procedure for extracting unclassified vehicular counts from CP data. At the classification level, accuracy was reduced to 70.6 ± 11.5%. Achieved classification results are promising from a conceptual perspective. Nevertheless, further investigation is crucial for enhanced classification performance and robustness."
15472450.2014.893736,"Macroscopic traffic flow models have been widely used to provide reliable prediction inputs for active transportation and demand management (ATDM). The representative models include METANET, FREFLOW, and KRONOS. In recent development of ATDM, METANET-based prediction models have started to more attention with their convenience of formulating several important macroscopic control variables, such as speed limit and ramp flow. However, applying METANET models on real-world observations (e.g., loop detector data) may experience significant performance issues, especially when applied to a corridor with heterogeneous links. Heterogeneous links refer to adjacent links that have different macroscopic traffic flow characteristics such as free flow speed and capacity. The heterogeneity is usually caused by changes in road geometry and environment, which commonly exist in urban freeway networks. This article provides an in-depth study to investigate the error mechanism of this problem and proposes several effective methods to improve the performance of METANET model over heterogeneous links. It is found in this article that applying some dynamic formulations to the convention term of the speed equation in METANET can significantly reduce the impact of link heterogeneity issue. The proposed method was evaluated using field loop detector data collected at I-894 corridor in Milwaukee, WI."
15472450.2014.936289,"Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) offer travelers a number of benefits, such as reduced travel time and uncertainty and improved traffic safety. The reliability of travel time provided by ATIS has an effect on the travelers’ choice of routes. However, the market for ATIS devices is a niche market, and its users may or may not follow the information and instructions provided by the system. Hence there is some information heterogeneity among travelers, which arises from the imperfect information with regard to other travelers’ preferences and types. This study applies the concept of a Bayesian game to the route choice problem when travelers are maximizing their degree of satisfaction by choosing routes. A Bayesian model is used in this work to analyze the impact of this heterogeneity on travelers’ route choices. We find that the use of ATIS exposes certain heterogeneities in traveler types and beliefs."
15472450.2014.936292,"Transit signal priority (TSP) has gained popularity in providing public transportation buses with preferential treatment at signalized intersections. Many studies have addressed its implementation in prompting enhanced public transportation service, such as reducing person delay and reducing transit travel time. However, most TSP implementations are done at the intersection level. Only a few studies have addressed the problem of integrating signal priority in coordinated real-time traffic signal control systems. A particular problem in this case is the uncertainty of predicting transit movements when considering the variability of dwell times at service stops. This study presents the development of a real-time traffic signal control integrating traffic signal timing optimization and TSP control using genetic algorithms (GA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) modeling. The GA is used to find near-optimal signal timings. Six different signal control systems were evaluated: fixed-time control with and without standard TSP, actuated signal control with and without standard TSP, real-time GA-based control without TSP, and real-time GA-based with advanced TSP logic. The standard TSP is implemented at the intersection level, by providing either early green (red truncation) or green extension strategies whenever a bus exists. A traffic signal control system that incorporates GA to optimize the fitness function and ANN for transit travel time prediction is developed. A microscopic simulation environment using VISSIM 4.3 simulation environment is used to test the previously mentioned six traffic control systems. The simulation results show that the proposed control system can reduce transit vehicle delay and improve schedule adherence. The reductions in delay and schedule adherence are statistically significant."
15472450.2014.936294,"This article presents the results of an evaluation of a candidate variable speed limit (VSL) system that takes the space mean speeds (SMSs) from probe vehicles as its main input. The presented algorithm extends the capability of a model predictive control (MPC) VSL model with the input of SMS derived from vehicle probes and their corresponding space-based densities, instead of spot-based densities and detector speeds. The developed probe-based VSL was evaluated on an 8-km stretch of Highway 2, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, using Paramics microsimulation software. The performance of the probe-based VSL algorithm was examined under various traffic conditions and probe vehicle parameters. The findings of the probe-based VSL analysis support previous findings taking input from point detectors and showing that the efficiency of the VSL strategies was efficient only for a limited range of traffic conditions. The results of the analysis show the effectiveness of developing advanced freeway control algorithms that use the main input parameters from vehicle probes. The performance of the probe-based VSL system was also comparable to, and in some cases outperformed, the point-based detector algorithm. However, the algorithm was shown to be effective only for a high frequency of information updates and under a relatively high percentage of vehicles probe penetration percentage."
15472450.2014.941750,"Vehicle classification is an important traffic parameter for transportation planning and infrastructure management. Vehicle classification stations depend on accurate calibration and validation to yield meaningful results. Operating agencies spend millions of dollars to deploy vehicle classification stations to collect classified count data, yet very few of these stations are ever subjected to a rigorous performance evaluation to ensure that they are reporting accurate data. To date such performance monitoring has been prohibitively labor intensive and prone to human error. To address this problem we develop a classification performance monitoring system to allow operating agencies to rapidly assess the health of their classification stations on a per vehicle basis. We eliminate most of the labor demands and instead deploy a portable nonintrusive vehicle classification system (PNVCS) to classify vehicles, concurrent with an existing classification station. This article uses a LIDAR-based PNVCS but our approach is compatible with many other PNVCSs. The processing requires several intermediate steps, developed herein, including synchronizing the independent clocks and matching observations of a given vehicle between the two classification systems. The performance monitoring methodology automatically compares the vehicle classification between the existing classification station and the PNVCS for each vehicle. If the two classification systems agree, the given vehicle is automatically taken as a success. A human only looks at the vehicle when the two systems disagree, and for this task we have developed tools to semi-automate the manual validation process, greatly increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the human user. Thus, the PNVCS must be accurate enough to be used as a baseline, as verified herein. The methodology is applied to over 21,000 vehicles from several permanent and temporary vehicle classification stations to evaluate the performance of axle and length-based classification stations. The automated process does the bulk of the work, with only 8% of the vehicles requiring manual intervention. The user typically spent 3–5 seconds per vehicle reviewed, translating into only a few minutes to process the exceptions from all lanes over 1 hour of data. This approach offers a cost-effective solution to ensure that classification stations are providing accurate data, and for permanent classification stations the additional labor is a fraction of the cost to deploy the station in the first place."
15472450.2014.972762,"Our road and highway system has become a source of multiple types of “big data.” One such type of data is travel time data obtained from vehicle reidentification systems, a type that is increasingly available due to the implementation of existing and relatively new technologies such as license-plate recognition and Bluetooth-based wireless vehicle identification. Travel time data obtained in real time from such systems are used to update estimated travel times displayed on variable message signs, and research has also been conducted that utilizes travel time data as inputs to incident detection algorithms. Implementation of such systems and prior research has primarily focused on freeways and other free-flowing roads. However, such systems for travel time data collection are also being implemented on arterials. In this research an incident detection procedure that utilizes point-to-point travel time data obtained from an arterial vehicle reidentification system is developed and evaluated. Historical travel time data provided by a Bluetooth-based travel time data collection system and reported incident data are utilized to evaluate the procedure. The results show that the procedure provides a good balance of detection and false alarm rates."
15472450.2014.989718,"Variable speed limit (VSL) systems have been more widely implemented in Europe compared to the United States. Studies have demonstrated positive safety impacts of such systems; however, there are very few studies that used actual deployment data to investigate the operational benefits of VSL systems. This article presents the operational impacts of a VSL deployment on Interstate 270 in the state of Missouri in the United States. Techniques such as parametric curve fitting, nonparametric methods, and other statistical tests were used to identify the changes between before and after traffic conditions. The effect of VSL on traffic performance was investigated at eight heavily congested locations. The two-dimensional Kolmogorov–Smirnov test results indicated that flow–occupancy diagram changes were statistically significant at seven out of eight locations. The slopes of flow–occupancy plots for over critical occupancies were found to be steeper after VSL. Slight changes in critical occupancy were observed after VSL implementation. However, the changes were inconsistent across locations, with some witnessing an increase and others witnessing a decrease. The maximum flow prior to breakdown (the prebreakdown flow) decreased at four locations and increased at four locations after VSL. The maximum flow after breakdown (the postbreakdown flow) decreased at three locations and increased at five locations after VSL. The average daily duration of congestion decreased at five locations and increased at three locations after VSL. Findings of this study help to develop VSL control algorithms that are more efficient in improving VSL traffic operations benefits."
15472450.2014.995760,"In many cities, taxis equipped with global positioning system (GPS) devices are used as probe vehicles. However, there are cases when the data from such taxis are not suitable for use as traffic information because of long data polling intervals. There are also developing countries in which taxis are not equipped with GPS devices. In such cases, a probe vehicle system has to be established by allocating probe vehicle devices to taxi dispatch centers (TDCs). In this study, the authors analyze the efficient allocation of such probe vehicle devices to TDCs under the cost constraint and the assumption of independent link travel times, adopting a definition of efficiency based on the loss to travel time information users resulting from information errors. The travel time information obtained using a probe vehicle system is the sample mean of a statistical distribution and should be treated as a statistical variable. Thus, the information error, which leads to losses to information users, is also a statistical variable. The allocation problem minimizes such losses. The results from a case study show that the loss to information users changes with the time of day and among different city areas. It is also shown that probe devices should be evenly allocated among TDCs. If either the number of probe devices or the data collection period is limited, more probe devices should be allocated to the central urban area where the traffic is heavier."
15472450.2014.1000456,"Traffic speed estimation is a fundamental task for traffic management centers and a critical element of intelligent transportation systems. For this purpose, various sensors are used to collect traffic speed information. The cellular probe system is gaining market penetration and becomes a newly effective and practical traffic speed measurement technique. In this article, the handoff system, one type of cellular probe technology, is used for speed detection. However, the handoff coverage size is usually variable and consecutive handoff points are usually far apart on a freeway. To improve the accuracy of speed estimation, this article proposes a travel-time-based method to aggregate the estimation results of the cellular probe system and loop detectors. For the purpose of a rigorous analysis, data are generated from microscopic simulation models of virtual one-direction freeway segments under various traffic conditions. Thus, the correlations between estimation accuracy and handoff distance, traffic condition, and the number of loop detectors are evaluated and analyzed. The results show that best performance is achieved with the shortest handoff distance. The aggregation of estimated speeds from cellular probe system and loop detectors can improve the speed estimation accuracy by taking advantage of each sensor if the space of loop detectors is more than 500 m. Also, an increasing number of loop detectors will improve the accuracy. Furthermore, the improvement of integration accuracy is much better under free flow conditions than under congested conditions."
15472450.2014.889935,"This research identifies the advantage of connected vehicle environment in cyber-transportation systems (CTS) and proposes control strategies that can yield benefits from system and user perspectives. Particularly, the focus is to minimize the total stopped delay at signalized intersections for the entire trip of a user. Further, we define and assess the notion of fairness from the user perspective. We develop and implement a vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)-based signal controller within the framework of CTS. The test results from a network containing 15 signalized intersections show that the proposed fair queuing (FQ) algorithm performs better than the fixed control and real-time adaptive control in terms of both efficiency (system travel time) and fairness (minimizing the difference between maximum and mean intersection delay) across users."
15472450.2014.889918,"Since the introduction of the vehicle infrastructure integration (VII) and connected vehicle (CV) initiatives in the United States, numerous in-vehicle technologies based on wireless communications are currently being deployed. One of these technologies is cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) systems, which provide better connectivity, safety, and mobility by allowing vehicles to travel in denser platoons through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. Accordingly, the research presented in this article develops a simulation/optimization tool that optimizes the movement of CACC-equipped vehicles as a replacement for traditional intersection control. This system, which is named iCACC, assumes that the intersection controller receives vehicle requests to travel through an intersection and advises each vehicle on the optimum course of action ensuring no crashes occur while at the same time minimizing the intersection delay. Four intersection control scenarios are compared, namely: a traffic signal, an all-way stop control (AWSC), a roundabout, and the iCACC controller. The results show that the proposed iCACC system significantly reduces the average intersection delay and fuel consumption level by 90 and 45%, respectively. Additionally, the article investigates the impact of vehicle dynamics, weather conditions, and level of market penetration of equipped vehicles on the future of automated vehicle control."
15472450.2014.889916,"Driving on highways and arterial roadways involves vehicle acceleration, braking, cruising, coasting, and idling episodes. As the vehicle speed deviates from its “fuel optimum speed,” additional fuel is consumed, thus reducing the vehicle fuel efficiency. The research presented in this article develops a connected vehicle application entitled Eco-Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (ECACC) that uses infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication to receive signal phasing and timing (SPaT) data, predict future constraints on a vehicle's trajectory, and optimize its trajectory to minimize the vehicle's fuel consumption level. The trajectory optimization is made using a moving horizon dynamic programming (DP) approach. A modified A-star algorithm is developed to enhance the computational efficiency of the DP for use in real-time implementations. The model is calibrated and tested on 30 top-sold vehicles in the United States and is demonstrated to provide fuel savings within the vicinity of signalized intersections in the range of 5 to 30%."
15472450.2014.889926,"Given the current connected vehicles program in the United States, as well as other similar initiatives in vehicular networking, it is highly likely that vehicles will soon wirelessly transmit status data, such as speed and position, to nearby vehicles and infrastructure. This will drastically impact the way traffic is managed, allowing for more responsive traffic signals, better traffic information, and more accurate travel time prediction. Research suggests that to begin experiencing these benefits, at least 20% of vehicles must communicate, with benefits increasing with higher penetration rates. Because of bandwidth limitations and a possible slow deployment of the technology, only a portion of vehicles on the roadway will participate initially. Fortunately, the behavior of these communicating vehicles may be used to estimate the locations of nearby noncommunicating vehicles, thereby artificially augmenting the penetration rate and producing greater benefits. We propose an algorithm to predict the locations of individual noncommunicating vehicles based on the behaviors of nearby communicating vehicles by comparing a communicating vehicle's acceleration with its expected acceleration as predicted by a car-following model. Based on analysis from field data, the algorithm is able to predict the locations of 30% of vehicles with 9-m accuracy in the same lane, with only 10% of vehicles communicating. Similar improvements were found at other initial penetration rates of less than 80%. Because the algorithm relies on vehicle interactions, estimates were accurate only during or downstream of congestion. The proposed algorithm was merged with an existing ramp metering algorithm and was able to significantly improve its performance at low connected vehicle penetration rates and maintain performance at high penetration rates."
15472450.2014.889924,"Research efforts focused on the connected vehicle (CV) technology applications typically assume perfect communications among the vehicles and between the vehicles and the roadside equipment. However, a few studies, including this one, pointed out that the wireless communications experience packet drops, which might lead to a serious downgrade of the safety critical CV applications. Thus, the wireless communication simulators used to emulate the communications performance need to be properly calibrated to replicate the real-world vehicular communication environments. This study calibrated an NCTUns simulator for the dedicated short range communications (DSRC) of CV technology using the DSRC field test data executed on an instrumented intersection at the Turner–Fairbank Highway Research Center. Physical layer parameters (e.g., data rate and transmission power) as well as channel models are calibrated. The calibration applied a Latin hypercube sampling technique to generate multiple combinations of parameter sets. The calibrated NCTUns simulator produced much more realistic outputs than the uncalibrated one. Then a signalized intersection was simulated in a case study to further investigate the packet drops of DSRC-based CV communications. The results indicated that there were significant packet drops, requiring further research before implementing safety critical CV applications."
15472450.2014.889941,"The Connected Vehicle Safety Pilot Model Deployment is a major test of safety applications that are based on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) dedicated short range communications (DSRC). Approximately 3000 vehicles in a mid-sized city (Ann Arbor, MI) will be equipped with devices in order to assess safety benefits in a naturalistic environment. To ensure that sufficient data are collected, participants will be chosen so that their vehicles will interact frequently with each other and with the roadside equipment. Since the 3000 vehicles are a small fraction of all vehicles in the city, choosing a deployment strategy requires careful analysis of the network and traffic flows. This research describes the development of a regional traffic microsimulation model that was used to estimate the number and spatial/temporal locations of V2V interactions under various deployment strategies. Steps taken to develop the model included the following: (a) converted the existing network planning model for the Ann Arbor area to a regional microsimulation model, (b) developed a method to identify the numbers, origins, and destinations of trips using equipped vehicles, and (c) developed postprocessing code to track all equipped vehicles from the second-by-second microsimulation vehicle snapshot data and to identify interactions between equipped vehicles. This interaction information was integrated with available Integrated Vehicle-Based Safety Systems (IVBSS) data to estimate the potential number of conflicts among equipped vehicles. The resulting model was used to assess various safety deployment scenarios in a field operational test."
15472450.2014.889920,"This article first develops an integrated traffic-driving-networking simulator (ITDNS) intended for the design and evaluation of cyber transportation systems (CTS) and connected vehicle (CV) applications. The ITDNS allows a human driver to control a subject vehicle, in a virtual environment, that is capable of communicating with other vehicles and the infrastructure with CTS messages. The challenges associated with the integration of the three simulators, and how those challenges were overcome, are discussed. As an application example, an eco-signal system, which recommends the approach speed for vehicles approaching the intersection so as to minimize fuel consumption and emissions, was implemented in the ITDNS. Test drivers were then asked to virtually drive through a signalized corridor twice, one time with the eco-signal system in place and another without the system. Thanks to the human-in-the-loop component of ITDNS, the research was able to evaluate the likely benefits of the eco-signal system, while accounting for the response of human drivers to the recommended speed profiles. Moreover, the study compared the energy consumption and emission production rates of human-controlled vehicles’ approach trajectories to the rates associated with “idealistic” trajectories that may be attainable via vehicle automation. With respect to ITDNS, the study demonstrates the unique advantages of the simulator and the broad range of applications it can address. Regarding the eco-signal application example, preliminary results demonstrate the potential of the concept to result in tangible reductions of around 9% for energy consumption, 18% for carbon monoxide, and 25% for nitrogen oxides emissions. Moreover, the application eliminated hard accelerations and decelerations maneuvers, and thus may have an additional positive safety impact."

Such a system involves vehicular control, communications links, and environment sensing. We propose a multiple stack architecture that is based on the nature of collaborative driving systems. The architecture facilitates the design, implementation, verification, and testing of a collaborative driving protocol. The advantage of using absolute time in a distributed system is also demonstrated. Specifically, we propose a merge protocol that assists a driver in merging with other vehicles based on the proposed architecture. We create a lock protocol and specify it as an extended finite state machine as a subroutine of the merge protocol. Absolute time simplifies a deadlock-free lock protocol. The lock protocol is verified using probabilistic verification."
15472450.2014.1000455,"Truck probe data collected by global positioning system (GPS) devices has gained increased attention as a source of truck mobility data, including measuring truck travel time reliability. Most reliability studies that apply GPS data are based on travel time observations retrieved from GPS data. The major challenges to using GPS data are small, nonrandom observation sets and low reading frequency. In contrast, using GPS spot speed (instantaneous speed recorded by GPS devices) directly can address these concerns. However, a recently introduced GPS spot-speed-based reliability metric that uses speed distribution does not provide a numerical value that would allow for a quantitative evaluation. In light of this, the research described in this article improves the current GPS spot speed distribution-based reliability approach by calculating the speed distribution coefficient of variation. An empirical investigation of truck travel time reliability on Interstate 5 in Seattle, WA, is performed. In addition, correlations are provided between the improved approach and a number of commonly used reliability measures. The reliability measures are not highly correlated, demonstrating that different measures provide different conclusions for the same underlying data and traffic conditions. The advantages and disadvantages of each measure are discussed and recommendations of the appropriate measures for different applications are presented."
15472450.2014.1001027,"Handoff-based cellular probe technologies have been proven to be a cost-effective solution for traffic surveillance due to their low cost, large sample size, and intensive spatial coverage. At the same time, the development of reliable simulation tools that can be used to conduct a feasibility study, performance evaluation, and estimation model testing for cellular probe technologies, especially in the arterial environment, is still limited. In this study, by simulating the real-world signal delaying and wireless signal communication protocols, we establish a simulation platform for evaluating cellular probe system. The simulation platform eliminates unrealistic assumption on static and regular cell boundaries in the existing simulation tools and can provide simulation results similar to field observations. Based on the platform, we compared the performance of cellular probe system under both freeway and arterial environment. We analyzed the impact of traffic conditions, the duration of cellphone calls, and penetration rate on the handoff efficiency, handoff link speed error, and information-disseminating link speed estimation error. In addition, we also provide a detailed evaluation of the accuracy of the intersection delay estimation and the potential error sources and mechanism.

15472450.2015.1004063,"Road vehicle detection and, to a lesser extent, classification have received considerable attention, in particular for the purpose of traffic monitoring by transportation authorities. A multitude of sensors and systems have been developed to assist people in traffic monitoring. Camera-based systems have enjoyed wide adoption over the last decade, partially substituting for more traditional techniques. Methods based on road-pavement vibration are not as common as camera-based systems. However, vibration sensors may be of interest when sensors must be out of sight and insensitive to environmental conditions, such as fog. We present and discuss our work on detection and classification of vehicles by measurement of road-pavement vibration and by means of supervised machine learning. We describe the entire processing chain from sensor data acquisition to vehicle classification and discuss our results for the task of vehicle detection and the task of vehicle classification separately. Using data for a single vibration sensor, our results show a performance ranging between 94% and near 100% for the detection task (1340 samples) and between 43% and 86% for the classification task (experiment specific, between 454 and 1243 samples)."
15472450.2015.1011638,"The provision of real-time information concerning bus arrival times could potentially reduce the uncertainty associated with public transport trips and improve the overall level of service. In addition, real-time predictions might enable operators to apply proactive control strategies. Even though considerable research efforts were devoted to the development of bus arrival prediction schemes, there is a lack of knowledge on the performance of real-world operational systems. This article aims to investigate the performance of a commonly deployed real-time information generation scheme. A conventionally used scheme is implemented and evaluated based on an empirical analysis. Performance metrics concerning the prediction error accuracy and reliability and their impact on expected waiting time were formulated from both passengers’ and operators’ perspectives. The real-time information generator was applied on the trunk line network in Stockholm, Sweden. The accuracy and reliability of the prediction scheme was analyzed by comparing the generated predictions against vehicle positioning data. This scheme was found to systematically underestimate the remaining waiting time by 6.2% on average. The provision of real-time information yields a waiting time estimate that is more than twice as close to the actual waiting times than the timetable. This difference in waiting time expectations is equivalent to 30% of the average waiting time."
15472450.2015.1015721,"Traffic volume data have been collected and used for various purposes in some aspects of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications. However, the unavoidable detector malfunction can cause data to be missing. It is often necessary to develop an effective approach to recover the missing data. In most previous methods, temporal correlation is explored to reconstruct missing traffic volume. In this article, a new missing traffic volume estimation approach based on tensor completion is proposed by exploring traffic spatial–temporal information. The tensor model is utilized to represent traffic volume, which allows for exploring the multicorrelation of traffic volume in spatial and temporal information simultaneously. In order to estimate the missing traffic volume represented by the tensor model, a novel tensor completion algorithm, called low multilinear rank tensor completion, is proposed to reconstruct the missing entries. The proposed approach is evaluated on the PeMS database. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective than the state-of-art methods, especially when the ratio of missing data is high."
15472450.2015.1015847,"Driving road identification is the key issue of a vehicle navigation system that supports various services of intelligent transportation systems. The method for driving road identification is also known as map matching (MM). In spite of the development of MM algorithms, limitations still exist in obtaining the positioning data and preparing candidate roads (CRs) that may result in mismatches in some special difficult road configurations such as flyovers and parallel roads. To overcome the limitations, an integrated trajectory-based MM (tbMM) system is proposed based on the trajectory similarity evaluation method. The system can fuse the information from global positioning systems (GPS) and inertial sensors to generate the vehicle trajectory that represents the vehicle continuous movement in three dimensions. The elevation data of vehicle and roads are involved to enhance the trajectory-based matching process. Also the method employs an optimized mechanism for generating and maintaining CRs. Using the mechanism, separated road segments in a digital map are reorganized in the form of possible driving roads and the topology among them is guaranteed. Moreover, the CRs are obtained considering all the possibilities in determining the driving road so that the valuable historical information can be effectively reserved to provide more reliable matches in ambiguous situations. The tbMM system was evaluated using a number of real-world vehicle-level test datasets in urban areas in Beijing. Also a comparison test was performed to evaluate the driving road identification accuracy against existing MM algorithms. The results show that the tbMM system can provide reliable matches with about 99% accuracy in all the difficult scenarios and outperforms the existing algorithms."

Although encouraging results have been obtained until now, a wide range of traffic circumstances has to be investigated in order to get reliable CACC systems driving on real roads. Among them, handling both vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications-equipped and unequipped vehicles merging into the string of CACC vehicles is a commonly mentioned challenge. In this article, an algorithm for managing the transitions in response to cut-ins from V2V- or non-V2V-equipped vehicles is developed and tested using a string of four CACC vehicles. A CACC controller is implemented in four production Infiniti M56s vehicles and tested in real traffic, where non-V2V-equipped vehicles can cut in. The effects of a vehicle performing a cut-out are also investigated. Then responses to cut-ins by equipped and nonequipped vehicles are simulated for longer strings of vehicles using car-following models for both the production adaptive cruise control (ACC) system and the newly developed CACC controller. Results demonstrate that the CACC system is able to handle cut-in vehicles without causing major perturbations, while also reducing significantly the impact of this maneuver on the following vehicles, improving traffic flow."
15472450.2015.1037955,"A methodological framework for multiple steps ahead parking availability prediction is presented. Two different types of predictions are provided: the probability of a free space to continue being free in subsequent time intervals, and the short-term parking occupancy prediction in selected regions of an urban road network. The available data come from a wide network of on-street parking sensors in the “smart” city of Santander, Spain. The sensor network is segmented in four different regions, and then survival and neural network models are developed for each region separately. Findings show that the Weibull parametric models best describe the probability of a parking space to continue to be free in the forthcoming time intervals. Moreover, simple genetically optimized multilayer perceptrons accurately predict region parking occupancy rates up to 30 minutes in the future by exploiting 1-minute data. Finally, the real time, Web-based, implementation of the proposed parking prediction availability system is presented."

Accurate forecasting results are useful to indicate future traffic conditions and assist traffic managers in seeking solutions to congestion problems on urban freeways and surface streets. There is new research interest in short-term traffic flow forecasting due to recent developments in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) technologies. Previous research involves technologies in multiple areas, and a significant number of forecasting methods exist in the literature. However, most studies used univariate forecasting methods, and they have limited forecasting abilities when part of the data is missing or erroneous. While the historical average (HA) method is often applied to deal with this issue, the forecasting accuracy cannot be guaranteed. This article makes use of the spatial relationship of traffic flow at nearby locations and builds up two multivariate forecasting approaches: the vector autoregression (VAR) and the general regression neural network (GRNN) based forecasting models. Traffic data collected from U.S. Highway 290 in Houston, TX, were used to test the model performance. Comparison of performances of the three models (HA, VAR, and GRNN) in different missing ratios and forecasting time intervals indicates that the accuracy of the VAR model is more sensitive to the missing ratio, while on average the GRNN model gives more robust and accurate forecasting with missing data, particularly when the missing data ratio is high."
15472450.2015.1052906,"The problem of mode-specific travel time estimation is mostly relevant to arterials with different travel modes, including cars, buses, cyclists, and pedestrians. Traditional travel time measurement systems such as automated number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras detect only motor vehicles and provide an estimate of their travel times. Bluetooth technology has been used as an alternative to more expensive ANPR for travel time measurements in the recent past. However, Bluetooth-sensors detect discoverable electronic devices used by all travel modes. Bluetooth-based systems currently use the time stamp of device detection events by two sensors to estimate the travel time, and there is no direct way to estimate mode-specific travel times using this approach. Hence, estimating travel time using Bluetooth technology on urban arterials without classifying the modes of detected devices could provide a biased estimate. A novel method to estimate mode-specific travel times using Bluetooth technology that is capable of estimating mode-specific travel times, specifically distinguishing between the travel time of motor vehicles and bicycles, is presented in this article. The proposed method uses information about type of detected device (class of device, CoD) and radio signal strength indication (RSSI). The proposed method also uses the travel time of the detected device and its detection pattern across the road network by multiple Bluetooth sensors to estimate the travel mode of each detected device. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated against the ground truth obtained by manual transcription of traffic video recordings, and was compared against travel times obtained from ANPR, a commercially deployed Bluetooth-based method, and a clustering method. The results show that the proposed method provides travel time estimates using Bluetooth with almost the same level of accuracy as ANPR under mixed traffic conditions."
15472450.2015.1062728,"The connected vehicle is a rapidly emerging paradigm aimed at deploying and developing a fully connected transportation system that enables data exchange among vehicles, infrastructure, and mobile devices to improve mobility, enhance safety, and reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the transportation systems. This study focuses on micromodeling and quantitatively assessing the potential impacts of the connected vehicle (CV) on mobility, safety, and the environment. To assess the benefits of CVs, a modeling framework is developed based on traffic microsimulation for a real network located in the city of Toronto, Canada, to mimic communication between enabled vehicles. In this study, we examine the effects of providing real-time routing guidance and advisory warning messages to CVs. In addition, to take into account the rerouting in nonconnected vehicles (non-CVs) in response to varying sources of information such as apps, global positioning systems (GPS), variable message signs (VMS), or simply seeing the traffic back up, the impact of fraction of non-CV vehicles was also considered and evaluated. Therefore, vehicles in this model are divided into; uninformed/unfamiliar not connected (non-CV), informed/familiar but not connected (non-CV) that get updates infrequently every 5 minutes or so (non-CV), and connected vehicles that receive information more frequently (CV). The results demonstrate the potential of connected vehicles to improve mobility, enhance safety, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) at the network-wide level. The results also show quantitatively how the market penetration of connected vehicles proportionally affects the performance of the traffic network. While the presented results are pertinent to the specifics of the road network modeled and cannot be generalized, the quantitative figures provide researchers and practitioners with ideas of what to expect from vehicle connectivity concerning mobility, safety, and environmental improvements."
15472450.2015.1062729,"Dynamic message signs (DMS) have been widely used by transportation agencies to disseminate traffic information (referred to in this article as “public traffic information”) for decades. Unfortunately, their effectiveness is limited, based on the following reasons: they are costly, can only present a limited amount of information, and typically only display information in one language. The wide availability of smart devices and the development of connected vehicles offer the possibility to create “virtual” DMS (VDMS), utilizing geofencing and audible messages to convey public traffic information. This research compares the ability of VDMS to convey public traffic information with existing DMS. A mixed repeated-measure experiment using a driving simulator was designed that examined the impacts of driver age, information transmission mode, amount of information, and driving complexity on message comprehension. Forty-two participants were recruited and each of them was tested under different combinations of the three within-subject factors. Participant performance was measured in terms of message comprehension, distraction, and self-reported overall difficulty level in receiving messages. Results revealed that VDMS generally performs better than DMS as information content increases and driving condition complexity increases, regardless of driver age. VDMS increased message comprehension by 16% under relatively complex driving conditions, reduced driver reaction time to unexpected stimuli (as measured with a reduced time-to-brake of 0.39 s), and made the same messages easier to process and retain for drivers than DMS. Based on these results, it is recommended that transportation agencies give careful consideration to VDMS as a future strategy for delivering public traffic information in a connected vehicle environment."
15472450.2015.1063424,"Because of the rapid increase of vehicle numbers and land values, there is an increasing shortage in the supply of parking facilities in many cities. In many parking lots, residential drivers bought private parking spaces with high prices to ensure that they have spaces to park at any time. Recently, some parking lot operation companies plan to temporally repurchase a few private parking spaces back during certain time periods in a day and sell these places to public users to fully utilize the limited parking resources. How to choose the repurchase amounts and stopping time so as to maximize the profit then becomes an important problem. To solve this problem, a Gaussian mixture model is first proposed in this article to describe the time-varying arriving/departing behaviors of drivers and meanwhile the stochastic constraints of the profit maximization problem. Then, the expected optimal repurchase amounts and stopping time are estimated via simulation optimization. This new approach not only provides a useful statistical tool for parking spaces modeling but also overcomes several key limitations of current queuing based methodologies. Particularly, it emphasizes how to model drivers' behaviors on a small time-scale and explains the resulting benefits."
15472450.2015.1065740,"Due to globalization trends and the increasing competition between ports, the maritime policy for container shipments has witnessed a change in operations that resulted in less reliance on direct freight flows and higher transshipment operations. Motivated to investigate a soft intelligent decision-making approach using game theory in the context of servicing vessels during unloading operations in transshipment, we propose an epsilon bargaining approach between the carrier and the container terminal operator (CTO). The objective of the game is to maximize the carrier service level while minimizing operation costs for the CTO. The players' utilities, which depend on the service level and the fees for the carrier, as well as the revenues generated and the cost incurred for the CTO, are uniquely formulated and evaluated in a bargaining scenario using an ordinal ranking approach. The negotiation process is further improved between the two players based on our proposed Epsilon Bargaining Equilibrium, which to the best of our knowledge has not been used in maritime transportation problems. Results from a risk aversion case illustrate the value of the soft computing mathematical model that we formulated and motivate follow-up research."
15472450.2015.1072050,"Traffic prediction is critical for the success of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). However, most spatio-temporal models suffer from high mathematical complexity and low tune-up flexibility. This article presents a novel spatio-temporal random effects (STRE) model that has a reduced computational complexity due to mathematical dimension reduction, with additional tune-up flexibility provided by a basis function capable of taking traffic patterns into account. Bellevue, WA, was selected as the model test site due to its widespread deployment of loop detectors. Data collected during the 2 weeks of July 2007 from 105 detectors in the downtown area were used in the modeling process and traffic volumes predicted for 14 detectors for the entire month of July 2008. The results show that the STRE model not only effectively predicts traffic volume but also outperforms three well-established volume prediction models, the enhanced versions of autoregressive moving average (ARMA) and spatiotemporal ARMA, and artificial neural network. Even without further model tuning, all the experimental links produced mean absolute percentage errors between 8% and 16% except for three atypical locations. Based on lessons learned, recommendations are provided for future applications and tune-up of the proposed STRE model."
15472450.2015.1074575,"A commonly used strategy for improving mobility along signalized arterials is to coordinate neighboring intersections to minimize vehicle stops by maximizing the duration of green bands, otherwise known as arterial bandwidth. Signal coordination has been researched, developed, and refined for five decades. In lieu of traditional methods that are based on the analysis of programmed green times (which assume all phases operate at their maximum settings), a dynamic bandwidth analysis method is presented that reproduces actual dynamic bandwidth durations using closed loop signal data. The analysis is intended to help assess the performance of semi-actuated coordinated signal systems on arterial streets. In addition, the study highlights the arterial progression benefits that result from changing coordinated intersection offsets based on optimizing the dynamic, rather than the programmed, bandwidths. Detailed analysis at three arterial sites revealed that coordinated green phase time distributions are complex and multimodal and cannot be represented by a single-valued statistic. Dynamic bandwidth analysis confirmed that programmed green bandwidth consistently underestimates the size of the actual dynamic bandwidth, and exhaustive search results highlighted the potential for further improvements in coordination. Future research will include field and simulation comparative studies and the development of efficient methods for dynamic bandwidth optimization."

15472450.2016.1149699,"This paper demonstrates the power and value of connecting satisfaction surveys from public transportation passengers to smartphone tracking data and automatic vehicle location (AVL) data. The high resolution of the smartphone location data allows travel times to be dissected into their individual components, and the connection with AVL data provides objective information on personal-level experiences of the respondents. Analyses show how these data can provide a quantitative understanding of the relationship between planned and provisioned service, and customer satisfaction. In-vehicle travel time data from 2,403 trips made by 529 unique participants could be obtained, along with origin wait time data for 779 of the trips and transfer time data for 188 trips. The addition of unreliability to the measurement of travel times, which is enabled by the highly detailed tracking data, shows that the relationship between passenger satisfaction and experienced travel times may be more nuanced than has previously been acknowledged. Ordinal logit model estimation results show a strong sensitivity of passenger satisfaction toward in-vehicle delays, and show that delays on board metro trains are perceived as more onerous than delays on board buses. This study also reveals the importance of obtaining a general measurement of satisfaction with transit service when repeated satisfaction measurements are conducted with respect to individual experiences. A baseline satisfaction level and a variable component as a function of experiences can be observed in the model results. Furthermore, the survey data include a measure of subjective well-being, which is a relatively new element in travel surveys. Insights are presented on the importance of this potential new covariate for future survey designs."

15472450.2015.1091735,"Real-time traffic flow forecasting is of great importance in the development of advanced traffic management systems and advanced traveler information systems. Traffic flow is evaluated using time series, and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model has been commonly used for determining the regression-type relationship between historical and future data. However, the performance of the ARIMA model is limited by the difficulty of capturing nonlinear patterns and the challenges of diagnosing permanent white noises. Hence, a hybrid method of ARIMA-EGARCH-M-GED was developed with the intent to address those limitations. It combines the linear ARIMA model with a nonlinear model of Exponent Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) to capture heteroscedasticity (the variance of random error varying across the data) of traffic flow series. EGARCH in Mean (EGARCH-M), which corrects the expression of conditional variance by connecting the conditional mean directly with the variance, was introduced to better restrain the influence of abnormal data. Moreover, the tail of the generalized error distribution (GED) is better than that of the normal distribution in characterizing the features of time series, especially heteroscedasticity of residual sequences. Data collected from an interstate highway (I-80 in California) with a sampling period of 5 minutes were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results from the hybrid model were compared with ARIMA, an artificial neural network, and a K-nearest neighbor model. The results showed that the hybrid model outperformed the other methods in terms of accuracy and reliability. Overall, the proposed model performed well in tracking the features of measured data and controlling the impact of abnormal data."

15472450.2015.1120674,"Given the increase of vehicles in traffic, traffic accidents have become a crucial and urgent issue for some countries. Particularly, in heavy traffic conditions, rear-end collisions make up the majority of traffic accidents, which make the traffic jam worse. This article proposes a novel approach to rear-end collision warning systems using areas of license plates acquired with a single camera mounted on a car. The edges of the front car's license plate are segmented and a rectangle is sketched to calculate the area, which is used for estimating distance between the cars. Relative speed of the front car is computed using the differences of the rectangles in a specific time. Distance and relative speed are obtained from the estimated areas of the license plates and transferred to the fuzzy inference system to send a warning signal to the driver for collision prevention, in emergency cases. The experiments are greatly encouraging, indicating that number plate segmentation can be utilized to estimate the distance and fuzzy inference system can be developed to create a warning signal to the drivers."

To remedy the defects of present Global Positioning System and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V-I) positioning technology, a new positioning approach based on vision and V-I communication is proposed. This approach aims at lane-level positioning with lower cost than conventional ones. In this approach, the position of the vehicle is represented by its lateral position (the lane number) and longitudinal position (the distance from entrance of the road) in a course coordinate system along the road; the specific lane the vehicle is occupying (the lane number) can be judged using the information of lane lines detected by vision systems; then the distance to the vehicle is obtained by a Road Side Unit (RSU) during the V-I communication; and the longitudinal position is calculated. The error of the approach on typical operating conditions is analyzed, indicating that the new approach can achieve the accuracy of less than 0.31 m for straight road and 0.58 m for typical arc road with ultra-wideband communication and ranging technologies and rational arrangement of RSUs.

15472450.2018.1484738,"The estimation of urban arterial travel time distribution (TTD) is critical to help implement Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and provide travelers with timely and reliable route guidance. The state-of-practice procedure for arterial TTD estimation commonly assumes that the path travel time follows a certain distribution without considering link correlations. However, this approach appears inappropriate since travel times on successive links are essentially dependent along signalized arterials. In this study, a copula-based approach is proposed to model arterial TTD by accounting for spatial link correlations. First, TTDs on consecutive links along one arterial in Hangzhou, China are investigated. Link TTDs are estimated through the nonparametric kernel smoothing method. Link correlations are analyzed in both unfavorable and favorable coordination cases. Then, Gaussian copula models are introduced to model the dependent structure between link TTDs. The parameters of Gaussian copula are obtained by Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Next, path TTDs covering consecutive links are estimated based on the estimated copula models. The results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed copula-based approach, compared with the convolution without capturing link correlations and the empirical distribution fitting methods in both unfavorable and favorable coordination cases."
15472450.2018.1493929,"The main objective of this paper is to develop a framework for short-term traffic flow forecasting models with high accuracy. Due to flow oscillations, the real-time information presented to the drivers through variable message signs, etc., may not be valid by the time the driver reaches the location. On the other hand, not all compartments of the flow signal are of same importance in determining its future state. A model is developed to predict the value of traffic flow in near future (next 5–35 minutes) based on the combination of wavelet transformation and artificial neural networks. This model is called the hybrid WT-ANN. Wavelet transformation is set to denoise the flow signal, i.e., filtering the unimportant fluctuations of the flow signal. Unimportant fluctuations are those that have little or no effect on the future condition of the signal. The neural network is set and trained to use previous data for predicting future flow. To implement the system, traffic data of US-101 were used from Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM). Results show that removing the noises has improved the accuracy of the prediction to a great extent. The model was used to predict the flow in three different locations on the same highway and a different highway in a different country. The model rendered highly reliable predictions. The proposed model predicts the flow of next 5 min on the same location with 2.5% Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and of next 35 min with less than 12% MAPE. It predicts the flow on downstream locations for next 5 min with less than 8% MAPE and for the different highway with 2.3% MAPE."
15472450.2018.1506338,"Drivers’ behavior evaluation is one of the most important problems in intelligent transportation systems and driver assistant systems. It has a great influence on driving safety and fuel consumption. One of the challenges in this regard is the modeling perspective to treat with uncertainty in judgments about driving behaviors. Really, assessing a single maneuver with a rigid threshold leads to a weak judgment for driving evaluation. To fill this gap, a novel neuro-fuzzy system is proposed to classify the driving behaviors based on their similarities to fuzzy patterns when all of the various maneuvers are stated with some fuzzy numbers. These patterns are also fuzzy numbers and they are extracted from statistical analysis on the smartphone sensors data. Our driving evaluation system consists of three processes. Firstly, it detects the type of all of the maneuvers through the driving period, by using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. Secondly, it extracts a new feature based on the acceleration and assigns three fuzzy numbers to driver’s lane change, turn and U-turn maneuvers. Thirdly, it determines the similarity between these three fuzzy numbers and the fuzzy patterns to evaluate the safe and the aggressive driving scores. To validate this model, Driver’s Angry Score (DAS) questionnaires are used. Results show that the fusion of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors of smartphones is enough for the proposed driving evaluation system. Accuracy of this system is 87% without using GPS and GIS data and this system is independent of smartphones and vehicles types."
15472450.2018.1527693,"In this research, a hybrid dead reckoning error correction scheme is developed based on extended Kalman filter (EKF) and map matching (MM) to improve the positioning accuracy for vehicle self-localization. The developed method aims at obtaining accurate positions when the GPS signals are occasionally unavailable or weakened. First, the heading data collected from an odometer and an optical fiber gyroscope are integrated by an EKF to reduce the random errors in dead reckoning. Then a modified topological MM algorithm is developed to reduce the systematic errors in dead reckoning. In this work, both cross-track errors and along-track errors are considered to improve positioning accuracy of MM. The errors are finally corrected using the results achieved from both the dead reckoning and the MM when the driving distance of a vehicle exceeds a predefined length or the vehicle turns in an intersection. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the developed method and the results show that the maximum error and average error of dead reckoning can be respectively reduced to 15.4 m and 5.2 m during the experiment with total distance of 43 km. This positioning accuracy is even better than the accuracy of the low-cost GPSs which are usually at the order of 15–20 m (95%).

15472450.2018.1502667,"In recent years, there has been a growing desire for the use of probe vehicle technology for congestion detection and general infrastructure performance assessment. Unlike costly traditional data collection by loop detectors, wide area detection using probe-based traffic data is significantly different in terms of the nature of data collection, measurement technique, coverage, pricing, and so on. Although many researches have studied probe-based data, there remains critical questions such as data coverage and penetration over time, or the influential factors in the accuracy of probe data. This research studied probe-sourced data from INRIX, to profoundly explore some of these questions. First, to explore coverage and penetration, INRIX real-time data was illustrated temporally over the entire state of Iowa, demonstrating the growth in real-time data over a 4-year timespan. Furthermore, the availability of INRIX real-time and historical data based on type of road and time of day, were explored. Second, a comparison was made with Wavetronix smart sensors, commonly used sensors in traffic management, to explore INRIX’s speed data quality. A statistical analysis on the behavior of INRIX speed bias, identified some of the influential factors in defining the magnitude of speed bias. Finally, the accuracy and reliability of INRIX for congestion detection purposes was investigated based on the road segment characteristics and the congestion type. Overall, this work sheds light onto some of the less explored aspects of INRIX probe-based data to help traffic managers and decision makers in better understanding this source of data and any resultant analyses."
15472450.2018.1486192,"Red-light-running (RLR) is an important reason for the large number of intersection-related fatalities, injuries, and other losses. The accurate RLR prediction can effectively reduce crashes caused by RLR behavior. The RLR prediction is usually composed of two parts: the vehicle’s stop-or-go behavior and the arrival time when the vehicle reaches the stop line. Previous stop-or-go prediction models are usually based on embedded traffic sensors using machine learning algorithms. While based on the continuous trajectories collected by radar sensors, RLR prediction can be conducted more effectively. In this paper, a probabilistic stop-or-go prediction model based on the Bayesian network (BN) is proposed for RLR prediction. We extend the deterministic output into the probabilistic output, which provides decision-makers with greater autonomy. The causality of BN improves the interpretability of the prediction model. The BN model is calibrated and tested by the continuous trajectories data measured by radar sensors installed at a signalized intersection. We not only consider the movement measurements of individual vehicles (e.g., speed and acceleration), but also take into account the car-following behavior. As a comparison, different machine learning models and the model based on the inductive loop detection (ILD) are adopted. The results show that the proposed BN model has a high prediction accuracy and performs better in the feature interpretation. This paper provides a new way for probabilistic RLR prediction based on continuous trajectories, which will significantly improve traffic safety of signalized intersections."
15472450.2018.1488133,"Pre-planned events such as constructions or special events lead to road capacity reductions and create bottlenecks in the traffic network. The traffic impact of such events goes beyond local areas, as informed drivers may detour to alternative corridors and consequently the traffic congestion may divert or propagate to other corridors. Due to the lack of real observation data, traditional traffic impact analyses are typically based on simulation models, fixed-location sensor data or survey questionnaires. In this research, we use high-resolution vehicle trajectory data collected via a smartphone app, which is capable of keeping track of individual driver’s behavior before and after road capacity reduction, to investigate travelers’ behavioral responses to pre-planned events and the contribution factors. For this purpose, a functional data analysis (FDA) approach-based clustering method is firstly proposed to cluster trajectory data and identify detour patterns, and two logistic and a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models are used to explain drivers’ detour behavior choice for each pattern with spatial and temporal features of interest. A case study based on a lane closure event on MoPac expressway in Austin, TX is used as an example in this research. The case study demonstrates that: (1) the freeway capacity reduction triggered heterologous behavior responses, (2) driver detour behavior exhibits three major patterns and (3) each detour pattern highly depends on spatial features such as trip length, distance to freeway entrance and distance to other alternative freeways, in addition to the temporal features when the trip happens."
15472450.2018.1525534,"Indoor simulator and on-road instrumented vehicle are the most popular ways to analyze driving behaviors by using collected Vehicle Sensor Data (VSD). However, for a same driver, the driving performance could be different in the real world and in the simulated world. Even though many studies have been conducted to discover the differences of driving behaviors in these two circumstances, little research has focused on analyzing the differences in driving style, which can provide more integrated knowledge of a driver from the natural structure, stimulus–response mechanism, of driving behaviors. Therefore, in this paper, the driving styles in both the real world and the simulated world are extracted by implementing the nonnegative matrix factorization method on the collected VSD data. Through this analysis, the driving style differences can be quantitatively described and discussed in detail. It is found that the drivers tend to be more unstable and sometimes aggressive when driving the simulator and the deviation in the perception of temporal gap in two circumstances is also discovered. The research findings are particularly valuable to calibrate the driving simulator and construct more reliable driving behavior models."
15472450.2018.1536978,"With the development of urbanization, road congestion has become increasingly serious, and an important cause is the traffic accidents. In this article, we aim to predict the duration of traffic accidents given a set of historical records and the feature of the new accident, which can be collected from the vehicle sensors, in order to help guide the congestion and restore the road. Existing work on predicting the duration of accidents seldom consider the imbalance of samples, the interaction of attributes, and the cost-sensitive problem sufficiently. Therefore, in this article, we propose a two-level model, which consists of a cost-sensitive Bayesian network and a weighted K-nearest neighbor model, to predict the duration of accidents. After data preprocessing and variance analysis on the traffic accident data of Xiamen City in 2015, the model uses some important discrete attributes for classification, and then utilizes the remaining attributes for K-nearest neighbor regression prediction. The experiment results show that our proposed approach to predicting the duration of accidents achieves higher accuracy compared with classical models."
15472450.2018.1470932,"Path travel time estimation for buses is critical to public transit operation and passenger information system. State-of-the-art methods for estimating path travel time are usually focused on single vehicle with a limited number of road segments, thereby neglecting the interaction among multiple buses, boarding behavior, and traffic flow. This study models path travel time for buses considering link travel time and station dwell time. First, we fit link travel time to shifted lognormal distributions as in previous studies. Then, we propose a probabilistic model to capture interactions among buses in the bus bay as a first-in-first-out queue, with every bus sharing the same set of behaviors: queuing to enter the bus bay, loading/unloading passengers, and merging into traffic flow on the main road. Finally, path travel time distribution is estimated by statistically summarizing link travel time distributions and station dwell time distributions. The path travel time of a bus line in Hangzhou is analyzed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results show that the model-based estimated path travel time distribution resembles the observed distribution well. Based on the calculation of path travel time, link travel time reliability is identified as the main factor affecting path travel time reliability."
15472450.2018.1528447,"Researchers have collected extensive vehicle activity data in Beijing using GPS and attempted to develop a comprehensive database of facility- and speed-specific operating mode (OpMode) distributions of various vehicle types for estimating on-road vehicle emissions. This study developed the specific OpMode distributions of light duty vehicles (LDVs) for both restricted access and unrestricted access road types at various average speeds for characteristic analysis. (1) Strong patterns are found in the variations in OpMode distributions with the increase in the average speed: the time fraction of Decelerating/Braking remains less than 7%. The fraction of Idling decreases dramatically from 95% to 0%, while the fraction of Cruising/Accelerating increases from 2% to 94%. The fraction of Coasting increases to 28% and then decreases. (2) The time fractions for restricted access and unrestricted access are significantly different at the same average speeds, especially in Operating Modes #0, #1, #11, #12, #13, #14, #21, and #22, possibly causing an error of 20% in the emissions estimations. (3) Taxis show different OpMode distributions than those for private cars in the operating modes of Decelerating/Braking, Idling, and high-VSP modes, especially at low average speeds. The differences are derived from the more skillful driving behaviors of taxi drivers and may cause an estimation error of over 10%. Thus, the activities of taxis and private cars should be modeled separately for on-road emissions estimations."
15472450.2018.1484739,"Carpooling is an environmentally friendly transportation system. It can efficaciously help resolve a variety of societal concerns of the urban areas, ranging from traffic congestion to environmental pollution. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model to solve the carpooling problem. The model simultaneously minimizes the costs of travel times, the vehicle use, and the vehicle delays. An exact solution method based on Branch-and-Bound (B&B) algorithm is proposed to efficiently obtain the optimal solution of the problem. In order to find the near-optimal solutions for large-scale problems, a heuristic beam search algorithm is introduced, which is based on the partial relaxation of some fathoming criteria applied in our proposed B&B. The computational experiments are conducted, based upon the transportation network of Isfahan city, Iran. The results demonstrate the great capability of the proposed exact solution method in terms of both computational solving time required and the number of the evaluated nodes, in comparison with CPLEX software package. The findings of this research can be applied to solve the carpooling problem compatible to the real-life situations."
15472450.2018.1488131,"This work investigates and discusses how the introduction of electric buses (EB), both battery and plug-in hybrid EB, will and should change the operations planning of a public transit system. It is shown that some changes are required in the design of a transit route network, and in the timetabling and vehicle scheduling processes. Other changes are not required, but are advisable, using this opportunity upon the introduction of EB. The work covers the main characteristics of different types of EB with a short description, including the most popular charging technologies, and it presents the generally accepted transit operations planning process. Likewise, it describes and analytically formulates new challenges that arise when introducing EB. The outcome of the analyses shows that multiple new considerations must take place. It is also shown that the different charging techniques will influence the operations planning process in different ways and to a varying extent. With overnight, quick and continuous charging, the main challenges are in the network route design step, given the possibility of altering the existing network of routes, with efficient and optimal changes of the timetabling and vehicle scheduling components. An illustrative example, based on four bus lines in Norrköping, Sweden, is formulized and introduced using three problem instances of 48, 82, and 116 bus trips. The main results exhibit the minimum number of vehicles required using different scenarios of charging stations."
15472450.2018.1488132,This study provides a novel solution for the synchronized and coordinated railway scheduling optimization (SCSO) problem by the determination of the departure times of a public transit network. Railway timetable optimization is dealt with maximizing the number of synchronized meetings to allow for smooth transfers at interchanges. The developed model uses binary variables to record the number of synchronized meetings considering the importance of transfer stations and rail lines without the need to apply the modeling of passenger assignments. The model allows for a permissible and flexible transfer waiting time for making a connection between rails instead of the commonly used and assumed values. The solution of the mixed-integer programing problem of larger-sized railway networks is based on a synchronized and coordinated scheduling optimization genetic algorithm (SCSO-GA) with a local search strategy (LSS). This solution method is proved to be more efficient and accurate than the CPLEX solver. In addition it is proven to be a periodic event-scheduling problem (PESP) solver. The model is tested computationally on the Beijing urban rail transit network. The results demonstrate the advantage of the novel approach over other methods.
15472450.2018.1525533,"According to the evolution tendency of the control decision process from a trackside to a train-borne system, various autonomous localization units for railway vehicles were developed. As recommended in railway standards, the design process of each system, here the autonomous localization units (LU), follows the V-model whose first step is to define its availability requirement in order to satisfy the global ETCS system requirements. The classical approach for assigning the subsystem availability is based on the assumption that failure parameters of other units are precisely known. This assumption is too restricted in reality due to the lack of information. In this paper, we propose a new approach that allows taking into account uncertainties in the dependability parameters of the ETCS components for identifying the upper threshold of the LU unavailability to reach ETCS availability requirements. Using fuzzy fault trees, the fuzzy unavailability of the ETCS without the autonomous LU is evaluated. Then, based on its membership function, we assess the satisfaction rate that an advanced ETCS with the autonomous LU can satisfy the ETCS availability target."
15472450.2018.1542303,"Under a stochastic roadway, drivers need a route guidance system incorporating travel time variability. To recommend a customized path depending on the trip purpose and the driver’s risk-taking behavior, various path ranking methods have been developed. Unlike those methods, our proposed disutility method can easily incorporate a target arrival time in the ranking process by measuring how late the travel is and by penalizing it depending on the severity of lateness. In addition, the disutility-based route guidance system can properly address travel time unreliability that causes unacceptable disruptions to the driver’s schedule (i.e., unexpected long delay). We compare the disutility-based path ranking method with other ranking methods, the percentile travel time, the mean excess travel time, and the on-time arrival probability. We show that the disutility has stronger discriminating power and requires less solution space to find an optimal path. The most important advantage is that it can estimate a driver’s risk-taking behavior for each trip purpose by using the discrete choice analysis. We construct a simulation framework to acquire the travel time data on a hypothetical roadway. We analyze the data and show how various ranking methods recommend a customized path. Using the data, we show the advantage of the disutiltiy method over the other methods, which is generating a customized path with respect to the target arrival time by properly penalizing the travel time lateness."
15472450.2018.1563865,"Congestion in transport stations could result in stampede development and deadly crush situations. Closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras enable station managers to monitor the crowd and reduce overcrowding risks. However, identifying congestion conditions is a very laborious task for a human operator who has to monitor multiple locations at the same time. This paper presents a new approach to automated image-based identification of congestion as measured by level of service (LOS), which is the most widely accepted standard for measuring congestion. Existing methods for measuring LOS based on crowd density estimation from images have the disadvantages that, crowd density cannot be estimated accurately. In addition, the calculation of flow parameters involves a complex process, and consequently these parameters are not indicative of congestion in real-time. This paper proposes a novel method based on machine learning to directly classify LOS without calculating flow parameters. In the proposed method, visual features extracted by a deep convolutional neural network are classified using a support vector machine classifier and the classification results are further refined by using a long short-term memory network. A second contribution of this research is to develop a web-based LOS map visualization platform to monitor pedestrian distribution and variation of distribution in real-time. Experimental evaluation at Flinders Street Station in Melbourne shows that this method can achieve an accuracy of 81.9% and efficiency of 0.40 seconds per frame in LOS classification using CCTV images."

15472450.2018.1494596,"Bus bunching is a well-known phenomenon for operators, users and regulators of high-frequency bus services. Bus operations are usually affected by increasing differences in the time intervals (headways) between consecutive buses. The effect of this variability is that buses tend to group into bunches of two or more, which severely affects the quality of service and the operational efficiency. The aim of this paper is to analyze which factors are associated to the phenomenon, using massive data from high-frequency services available in Santiago (Chile) and common-route services in Gatineau (Canada). The data is obtained from the bus GPS and AFC systems and are processed to obtain headways between buses. Using data from one week, we develop models to explain the variation of the continuous and discrete indicators of bus bunching as a function of variables related to the operation, variables related to the demand structure, and variables related to the infrastructure. Some of the factors that contribute to increase bus bunching are: stops located toward the end of the route, high scheduled frequency, irregular bus dispatch headways, non-homogeneous fleet, high demand, and high variability of demand. The results are useful for the design of quality indexes to measure bunching in bus operations, and for the design and operation of bus routes, taking into consideration the potential bus bunching problems."
15472450.2018.1496428,"Urban transportation and traffic face significant challenges as cities continue to grow. Traffic intersections present unique challenges for city planners. Several studies have proposed diverse approaches to managing intersection traffic. However, these typically fail to reduce both energy and trip time for all vehicles involved. This paper proposes the intersection traffic energy management system (ITEMS). By using speed regulation of two vehicles approaching an intersection on crossroads, ITEMS is able to resolve intersection conflicts. This obviates the need for either vehicle to stop. Two-vehicle and four-vehicle scenarios were simulated. It was found that ITEMS reduced the total energy about 22% and the trip time across the intersection by almost 16% for every scenario compared to a traditional fixed-timed traffic light intersection. ITEMS was also found to be superior than always giving a green light to urban transit vehicles. Furthermore, with ITEMS, the energy and trip time of each vehicle in the scenario was reduced when compared to other strategies."
15472450.2018.1501273,"Agent-based approach is a popular tool for modelling and developing large-scale distributed systems such as urban traffic control system with dynamic traffic flows. This study proposes a multi-agent-based approach to optimize urban traffic network signal control, which utilizes a mathematical programming method to optimize the signal timing plans at intersections. To improve the overall network efficiency, we develop an online agent-based signal coordination scheme, underpinned by the communication among different intersection control agents. In addition, the initial coordination scheme that pre-adjusts the offsets between the intersections is developed based on the historical demand information. Comparison and sensitivity analysis are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method on a customized traffic simulation platform using MATLAB and VISSIM. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method can effectively avoid network oversaturation and thus reduces average travel delay and improves average vehicle speed, as compared to rule-based multi-agent signal control methods."
15472450.2018.1504294,"Traffic congestion in urban network has been a serious problem for decades. In this paper, a novel dynamic multi-objective optimization method for designing predictive controls of network signals is proposed. The popular cell transmission model (CTM) is used for traffic prediction. Two network models are considered, i.e., simple network which captures basic macroscopic traffic characteristics and advanced network that further considers vehicle turning and different traveling routes between origins and destinations. A network signal predictive control algorithm is developed for online multi-objective optimization. A variety of objectives are considered such as system throughput, vehicle delay, intersection crossing volume, and spillbacks. The genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to solve the optimization problem. Three example networks with different complexities are studied. It is observed that the optimal traffic performance can be achieved by the dynamic control in different situations. The influence of the objective selection on short-term and long-term network benefits is studied. With the help of parallel computing, the proposed method can be implemented in real time and is promising to improve the performance of real traffic network."
15472450.2018.1506339,"Finding the optimal location for sensors is a key problem in flow estimation. There are several location models that have been developed recently for vehicle identification (ID) sensors. However, these location models cannot be applied to large networks because there are many constraints and integer variables. Based on a property of the location problem for vehicle ID sensors, given the initial vehicle ID sensors that are pre-installed and fixed on the network, this article presents a solution that greatly reduces the size of this location problem. An applied example demonstrates that when 8% of the arcs from a real network that are randomly selected have a vehicle ID sensor, the reductions are as large as 97% for the number of remaining constraints in the location model and 84% for the adjusted diameter of the feasible region of target flow. Using these two indices as target functions, two greedy algorithms are presented for solving the vehicle ID sensor location problem. These two algorithms were applied to an example in Mashhad city with 2,526 arcs, 7,157 origin-destination pairs and 121,627 paths. Using these algorithms, installing vehicle ID sensors on 8% of the network arcs results in satisfaction of 99.82% of the constraints in the location model and 97.6% reduction in the adjusted maximum possible error index. This means that deploying a low number of vehicle ID sensors on a real large network, with these greedy algorithms, yields a high level of observability."
15472450.2018.1518137,"Taxis provide a type of on-demand mobility service in urban transportation. There are growing concerns regarding the level of service of taxis in satisfying residents’ mobility demand. However, the mismatch between demand and supply of taxi services has not been resolved even with the introduction of app-based vehicle services. In this study, three indicators are constructed using the Shanghai taxi global positioning system (GPS) dataset to reveal the spatial–temporal mismatch pattern. The issue is further analyzed via a case study, in which seven regions with frequent mismatch patterns are identified in the time period from 21:00 to 22:00. Then, a multinomial logistic regression model is employed to identify the demographic and built-environment factors contributing to the taxi mismatch problem. The study results show that population density, residential areas, the number of points of interest, and road density have significant relationships with the taxi undersupply. In contrast, the areas of commercial lands, as well as the other two transportation-related factors, that is, the number of bus stops and the distance to nearest subway station, are observed to be statistically significant for both “oversupply” and “undersupply” conditions. This study provides valuable insights for identifying mismatch patterns and interpreting the mismatch problem as a function of spatially explicit factors that are of great use for urban governance, especially in the improvement of taxi efficiency, taxi management, and urban planning."

15472450.2018.1536859,"The majority of research efforts in the field of access control of autonomous vehicles at intersections are geared towards fully connected vehicles. The underlying assumptions for such efforts are active vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), infrastructure-to- vehicle (I2V) communications, and/or presence of a central controller. Though efficiency is proven to be significantly enhanced, the assumptions face inherent security and privacy obstacles and require high infrastructure costs. In previous work, the authors designed and demonstrated a simpler, less costly, and more secure approach to autonomous vehicle management at intersections. The approach allows vehicles to make autonomous decisions at intersections based solely on sensing and/or beacon information with no V2V or V2I communications required. This article extends our model to account for various vehicle classes, all possible turns at the intersection with corresponding safe turning speeds, and various intersection geometries. Compared to a fully actuated signal controller, the proposed and improved model is again proven operationally more efficient, as it reduced the average delay per vehicle by at least 21% and up to 51% for the various simulated scenarios. After 40 million seconds of simulation, the proposed model proved collision free operations."
15472450.2018.1557524,"As traffic congestion intensifies, identification and control of critical areas to balance road network traffic flow are of paramount importance to mitigate and prevent traffic congestion, based on the road network traffic realities. Most previous traffic sub-region division methods of static characteristics are not suitable for dynamic traffic management. This article proposes the division model of traffic sub-regions and identification method of critical control areas based on macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) theory closely integrated with dynamic characteristics of road network traffic. To be specific, the existence of small-scale road network MFD is confirmed at first through the traffic data transmitted from Jiangbei district in Chongqing, China. The initial control sub-regions of the road network are formulated with each small-scale road network as a control area. Then, the traffic state value of sub-regions is calculated by means of regression analysis. A set of rules are designed to aggregate the initial sub-regions, which are associated with the traffic state and geographically adjacent, and the adjusted traffic sub-regions are obtained by means of correlation coefficient analysis. Finally, the identification method of traffic critical control sub-regions is proposed based on clustering analysis. In addition, the identification model of critical control sub-regions is applied and analyzed in the experimental road network of Jiangbei district in Chongqing, China. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is flexible and efficient enough to improve the control over road networks, promoting application of traffic sub-region division based on MFD in dynamic traffic control over actual road networks."
15472450.2018.1560280,"This paper shows how embedded instantaneous kinematic information from files of vehicle trajectories can be exploited to better enable data compression algorithms for typical files containing all such trajectories from a roadway segment over some period of time. Such files typically contain other relevant information, such as vehicle class, lane number, and so on, and effective ways of compressing these variables are demonstrated as well. The test files are taken from the Next Generation Simulation project, as those files are to date the de facto standard for large trajectory repositories suitable for studying traffic flow theory. The advent of connected vehicles suggests that the data collection, storage, and hence, compression needs in this arena will continue to grow. We develop compression algorithms that exploit collective vehicle kinematics of the first and second order to enable greater compression ratios. Using the context-free .zip and .7z compression routines as baselines, we compare three schemes. The first scheme treats each column independently and does not recognize any variables as kinematic and produces compression gains approaching 2:1. The second scheme also compresses each column independently, but recognizes that some of them contain kinematic variables, and hence relationships along the rows, resulting in gains of around 4:1. Finally, the scheme that uses all of this information, plus kinematic correlations across columns, produces gains on the order of 5:1."
15472450.2018.1562348,"Using the conservation of mass concept, a novel controlled flow methodology based on a linear programing problem is developed for computing the optimal flow rates for a multi-exit evacuation network. In an emergency situation, the controlled flow design is able to track the values of the walkway density, the number of occupants in nodes and thus assures that the flow from adjacent sources to the source walkways is at their maximum level. Using the DTSP hall room of Universiti Sains Malaysia as a multi-exit network, a simulation of the flow shows that the source walkways are blocked when there is an uncontrolled flow. Hence, very few occupants can make their way into the intermediate walkways and exits. For the controlled flow, the values of occupant density in the source and intermediate walkways gradually approach the critical density, ensuring a maximum flow. The developed methodology is useful for the architects and disaster management authorities who are concerned with the evacuation of building facilities and can be used as a paradigm for future studies."
15472450.2018.1563864,"Advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) present traffic information to travelers to assist them in planning their journeys and also provide guidance when on the road. Providing travelers with information affects travel behavior and can result in improved performance and reduced congestion and emissions. However, the success of ATIS depends on, among other factors, whether drivers consider it useful and their particular responses to the provided information. There are, currently, many sources and market players in the traffic information industry producing traffic reports for consumers. The main objective of this paper was to examine whether traffic information provided from different sources are consistent with one other. A variable speed limit system and real-time traffic information system for in-vehicle navigation systems are used as a case study. This comparative analysis was made by superimposing the space-time regions of ground truth measured traffic conditions (“reality”) over the space-time regions of the reported information broadcasts. A predictive buffer was also introduced in the assessment. The predictive buffer was included to account for traffic information which could be considered as advance warning messages or correctly predicting and giving congestion information prior to the onset of actual congestion, which otherwise may have been reported as false alarms. This was motivated by the fact that optimal control approaches include the prediction of congestion in their control strategies. The methods developed in this research work have been applied to a real world problem to prove its applicability."

To improve fuel economy, in this study, we propose a double-layer speed optimization method with real-time computation that considers traffic signal information collected via vehicle-to-infrastructure communication and traffic conditions. In the first layer, we use a Dijkstra algorithm to optimize the average eco-speed between adjacent intersections with full-horizon traffic signal information, and in the second layer, we use an optimal control method to plan a real-time speed profile with average speed constraints. We conduct numerous field tests using a test bed and an experimental vehicle platform.

Research shows the numerical accuracy and convenience of Lagrangian traffic flow models in traffic state estimation. In this paper, a new traffic state estimation model by using Lagrangian-space Kalman filter is proposed based on the travel time transition model (TTM). The proposed methodology reformulates the TTM model into a state-space form to fit the Kalman filter framework. The corresponding state-updating matrices for various traffic conditions are also provided. A numerical experiment is conducted based on a simulation model calibrated with the field loop detector data on IH-894 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin for model evaluation. The proposed TTM-based method is compared with a CTM-based Kalman filter estimator on Eulerian coordinate under different penetration rates of the input Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or Cellular probe vehicle data in which vehicles are re-identified between two consecutive physical or virtual readers. The evaluation results indicate that TTM-based estimation model performs well especially during congestion and can track traffic breakdowns and recovery effectively. The TTM-based estimator outperforms CTM-based methods at all penetration rates levels. Furthermore, the 4% penetration rate is found to be a threshold beyond which TTM-based estimation results improve significantly. With increased penetration rates, the TTM-based model can achieve a mean absolute percentage error around 10%; while CTM-based model remains higher than 13%."
15472450.2018.1488218,"Parking space is a scarce resource in today’s cities. Travelers often spend a sizable amount of time searching for available parking spaces. This increases travelers’ overall travel cost and causes additional congestion on the road. Without a good parking information guidance system, parking search remains a trial and error process. In this article, we propose a dynamic parking guidance system that integrates parking destination switching and real-time traffic routing. Drivers can switch their parking destinations and routes during their trip to minimize their expected travel costs. The probability that a driver is willing to switch to a new parking garage is taken to be proportional to the cost difference of the current parking destination and the new one. Microscopic simulation using SUMO and OmNet++ is designed to test the proposed dynamic parking and route guidance system. The simulation results show that with the proposed joint dynamic parking destination switching and dynamic traffic routing, the average overall cost in the network can be reduced. From the parking resources management point of view, parking garage occupancy can be more balanced across all the parking garages with the proposed system, which indicates that the system can help better coordinate available parking resources and avoid potential over-utilization or under-utilization of parking resources."
15472450.2018.1562349,"Lane change is a basic and critical element of complicated driving maneuvers such as overtaking, merging, and exit. Improper lane change is a primary cause for car crashes. This article focuses on the cooperative lane change motion planning task for multiple connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). To describe this task in a straightforward, accurate, and generic way, a centralized optimal control problem should be formulated. This optimal control problem consists of a cost function and many constraints, including the vehicle kinematic constraints, collision-avoidance constraints, two-point boundary conditions, and so forth. However, this optimal control problem is difficult to solve, because the constraints related to all of the CAVs must be considered simultaneously. In order to facilitate the numerical solving process, an incrementally constrained dynamic optimization method is proposed. In this method, a series of subproblems are defined and solved in a sequence such that each one is more difficult than its former one by incorporating more collision-avoidance constraints. The optimum of each one subproblem serves as the initial guess, which warmly starts the solution process of the next subproblem in the sequence. This sequential process continues until the optimal solution to the originally formulated problem is derived. In this way, the difficulties in the original problem are dispersed into multiple parts and then tackled incrementally. Unification, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed method have been investigated through a series of simulation tests."
15472450.2019.1573366,This article proposed a real-time short turning strategy based on passenger choice behavior to improve transit service for the stops with larger passenger demand in peak periods. A bi-level model is introduced to integrate the real-time control strategy and passenger choice. The upper-level model is an optimal model with the objective of maximizing the reduced waiting time of passengers with the strategy. The lower-level model is an allocation model to calculate passenger demand accurately. The optimization variables include which buses provide short turning services and the start and end stations of each bus. An algorithm is implemented to solve the problem and the effectiveness of the presented strategy is tested with the data of a transit route in Dalian city of China. The results indicate that the real-time short turning strategy based on passenger choice behavior can yield benefits in term of the reduction of passenger waiting time and even the vehicle capacity up.
15472450.2019.1586543,"Previous map-matching algorithms perform well in sparse road areas and simple road network structures. Nevertheless, mismatches emerge when the algorithms are implemented in a complex road network. Special road patterns such as parallel or auxiliary roads, roundabouts, intersections, U-turns, or overpasses make it harder to identify features correctly. This paper proposes a scenario-based map-matching algorithm which balances accuracy and efficiency. Instead of matching every point by a constant process, the proposed algorithm provides specific combinations of filters for different operational environments. To eliminate improper candidate roads at each step, five road filters are introduced. Each filter has its own trigger condition, and if the condition is not satisfied, the filter will be skipped. The algorithm is validated using taxi GPS data on various complex roads in Shenzhen. The algorithm correctly identified 99.60%, 96.40%, 93.18%, 96.87%, and 94.11% of the roads for simple, opposing parallel, and auxiliary roads; intersections; and unconnected buffer situations, respectively. The proposed algorithm has two important features: 1. the algorithm is suitable for various complex intersections; 2.the map-matching process can be adjusted according to the traffic scenario, which saves computational time. The evaluated performance indicates that the proposed algorithm performs better than previous map-matching algorithms in both simple and complex road networks and can be efficiently applied to GPS datasets using various time intervals."
15472450.2018.1527694,"To improve the traffic efficiency of city-wide road networks, we propose a traffic signal control framework that prioritizes the optimal control policies on critical nodes in road networks. In this framework, we first use a data-driven approach to discover the critical nodes. Critical nodes are identified as nodes that would cause a dramatic reduction in the traffic efficiency of the road network if they were to fail. This approach models the dynamic of road networks using a tripartite graph based on the vehicle trajectories and can accurately identify the city-wide critical nodes from a global perspective. Second, for the discovered critical nodes, we introduce a novel traffic signal control approach based on deep reinforcement learning; this approach can learn the optimal policy via constantly interacting with the road network in an iterative mode. We conduct several experiments with a transportation simulator; the results of experiments show that the proposed framework reduces the average delay and travel time compared to the baseline methods."

In order for a CAV to operate safely, it needs information such as static data (high-resolution navigation maps) and real-time dynamics from various sensors, some of which exchange information with other vehicles or roadside units. High resolution navigation maps can integrate historical on-road driving performance data to help CAVs and drivers operating vehicles with low level automation make informed proactive decisions. This study proposes that navigation maps on CAVs come pre-installed with historical driving data and that they work together with real-time sensors to help CAVs plan maneuvers. Historical driving data offers insights about decisions made by drivers at locations along a route, e.g., where drivers often make sharp turns or where they accelerate and decelerate hard. A pre-installed record of historical driving decisions will support informed decision-making and proactively “warn” CAVs and drivers about potential hazards. This study explores location-based driving volatility as a key to improving safety through CAVs. Location-based volatility is a measure of historical driving performance, defined as the percentage of extreme maneuvers performed on a location in road network. For demonstration, we modeled and visualized real-world high-resolution geo-referenced data. The data comes from a connected vehicle safety pilot program in Ann Arbor, Michigan. We found measured location-based volatility is significantly related to safety outcomes. Therefore, location-based driving volatility can serve as a valuable piece of information to be added to navigation maps in CAVs in order to help them navigate volatile hot-spots."
15472450.2019.1615487,"The shipments of hazardous materials (hazmat) which are indispensable for economic and social development have increased; accordingly, a rising number of incidents involving hazmat transportation may inflict more dread damages to both people and environment. This severe situation has prompted the need for deep mining trip purposes using trajectory information in order to enhance the hazmat-transportation regulatory. This paper presents an unsupervised two-phase framework for inferring multiple trip purposes (i.e. loading, unloading, in-yard, and other stops) based on the passive global positioning system (GPS) data during the hazmat-transportation process. In detail, a scalable ordering points to identify the clustering-structure mixture algorithm (SOMA) is first developed to group hazmat vehicles trip ends into hotspot places in phase I; In phase II, a two-stage trip-purpose identification approach is proposed with a combination of the fuzzy c-means (FCM) method and the point-of-interest (POI) information. The effectiveness and efficiency of the designed two-phase framework are evaluated through the real-world datasets, which are generated by more than 12,000 vehicles in Liaoning Province, China. The results demonstrate that the method can infer four types of freight trip purposes with an accuracy of 82.1%. The proposed approach framework can help analyze the vehicle trips associated with the loading states, which will provide effective decision-making support for the hazmat-transportation regulatory."
15472450.2019.1677160,"The nature of wrong-way driving (WWD) crashes on limited access facilities makes it difficult for agencies to combat them effectively. WWD countermeasures equipped with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies, such as warning lights and detection devices, have been proven to reduce WWD. However, agencies often cannot deploy these ITS countermeasures at all exit ramps due to their expense. This paper discusses an innovative WWD countermeasure optimization approach to help agencies identify the optimal deployment locations based on available resources. The approach consists of a WWD crash risk (WWCR) model and a WWD countermeasures optimization algorithm. The WWCR model uses non-crash WWD events, interchange designs, and traffic volumes to predict the number of WWD crashes on multi-exit segments of limited access facilities. Then, the optimization algorithm uses the model results to identify the best exits for ITS countermeasure deployment based on WWCR reduction, available resources, and other applicable constraints. This approach was applied to the Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE) toll road network. Twenty-four segments were identified as WWD hotspots due to high WWCR. Three different optimization scenarios were tested to show how different constraints affect the results. These scenarios resulted in 38% to 41% of the maximum possible WWCR reduction by equipping only 39 of the 196 FTE ramps (20%) and could help FTE better utilize its investment by 36% compared to only equipping ramps in the identified 24 WWD hotspots. Other agencies could personalize this approach based on their available resources, and preferred WWD countermeasures to achieve similar benefits."
15472450.2019.1579091,"How to efficiently identify traffic bottlenecks in the expressway network and implement targeted measures is an important issue to mitigate traffic congestion. In recent years, with the proliferation of smartphones, smartphone-based navigation applications are receiving the worldwide popularity, which are being treated as an extremely rich source of traffic data. In this paper, we are devoted to proposing a novel approach to investigate traffic state and identify recurrent bottlenecks quickly and accurately from macroscopic network perspective, through fusing the data sources of fixed detectors and mobile navigation apps. First of all, this paper plots flow-speed fundamental diagram to derive critical speed, which is treated as the criterion to determine traffic state. Once the criterion has been established, typical bottlenecks in the entire expressway network can be efficiently identified through only utilizing smartphone-based probe speed data. Secondly, three pioneering indicators are put forward to quantify oversaturated traffic state and classify bottleneck patterns on urban expressway network. Applying this methodology, we take Beijing expressway network as a case to identify different patterns of bottlenecks, which are validated to comply with the reality. Moreover, the relationship between critical speed and the associated road segment features is explored and shows the possibility of predicting the critical speed even without flow data. As an end, some recommendations are proposed for improving different types of traffic bottlenecks."
15472450.2019.1579092,"Multistep prediction of public parking spaces in the parking guidance and information system and parking reservation system has great benefits for intelligent parking. This study analyzes the C0 complexity of parking space occupancy time series from the frequency domain aspect. Results show that regular components account for the vast majority of parking space occupancy time series and can be considered a “quasiperiodic” series, which provides the theoretical basis for multistep prediction. This study combines the idea of Fourier transform (FT) and a machine learning method least squares support vector regression (LSSVR) together and proposes the Fourier transform–least squares support vector regression (FT–LSSVR) multistep prediction algorithm. As taking consideration of a predicting step threshold, this method has the power to predict single-step and multistep public parking spaces. Verification on two typical public parking lots in Hangzhou shows the great performance of FT–LSSVR. The prediction accuracy of proposed FT–LSSVR immensely outperforms the traditional LSSVR prediction after considering the step threshold. Moreover, the proposed method did not add the computational time complexity compared with the traditional LSSVR prediction. Thus, the proposed method is more suitable for real-time systems for its high prediction accuracy and less complex calculation."
15472450.2019.1579093,"The emerging advanced intelligent transportation systems, such as connected vehicles (CV) and cooperative vehicle-to-infrastructure system (CVIS), attract much research attentions nowadays. Taking the advantages of such systems, first, this article develops a joint control model which optimizing the speeds of the connected vehicles and coordinating signals along an arterial simultaneously. This control model forms connected vehicles into platoons so that the vehicles can pass through intersections together with no stops or the least stop time. At the same time, it optimizes signal timing plans along an arterial to achieve lower signal delay and higher throughput. Finally, the proposed model is tested on a mimic of a real-world road network in simulation. Compared with the MAXBAND model, the results indicate that the joint control model can reduce the stop time and stops of coordinate phase by up to 53.69% and 41.15%. The signalized intersection delay per vehicle is reduced by 13.19%. Meanwhile, the vehicle queue is eliminated by the platoon control and arterial signal coordination. The sensitivity analysis also shows that the signalized intersection delay reduction is proportional to the traffic flow volume."
15472450.2018.1542305,"Model-based condition monitoring is an increasingly important area for rail transportation. The key elements of such condition monitoring methodologies are low-cost vehicle sensors and intelligent algorithms. In this study, a swarm intelligence-based multiple models approach is proposed to detect different friction conditions by using velocity measurements of a railway vehicle. In this case of application, estimated parameter is the maximum friction coefficient. Additionally, proposed methodology is tested experimentally by using the measurements taken from a tram wheel test stand. Multiple mathematical models of the test stand are created with different maximum friction coefficients, whereas all initial conditions and other system parameters are same for each model. Therefore, comparison of the output of each model with measurements is considered to interpret the parameter value of the model, which best represents the system, is selected as parameter estimate. Unlike the traditional multiple models approach, a swarm intelligence-based evolution of the models is proposed. Experiments carried out on the test stand reveal that the proposed methodology is promising to be used as an on-board friction condition monitoring tool for railway vehicles with traction. Furthermore, it can be considered to detect weather conditions since friction conditions change due to the weather events such as rain, ice, snowfall, condensation of water droplets, and leaves on the line and it can be used as an auxiliary system for intelligent traction and high adhesion control systems."
15472450.2018.1542304,"Reliable long-term travel time prediction would be effective support to traffic management, for example, traffic flow control or the pricing of tolls. Gradient boosting (GB) has been suggested as an excellent tool for short-term travel time prediction problems. This paper shows that GB with modifications can also work for long-term prediction. We introduce key variables, regarded as multiple factors, from various sources into a GB model and apply the Fourier filtering process to reduce noise. Those key variables include time of the day, day of the week, holidays, big events or activities, promotion of tolls, and narrowing of roadways. This paper takes the first step in applying key variables (from various sources) to predict long-term travel time. The electronic toll collection (ETC) data of Taiwan Freeway No.1 are used to train and to test in our process. Results demonstrate that the prediction ability of the GB model with Fourier filtering is the best.

15472450.2019.1582950,"Short-term traffic speed forecasting is an important component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Multi-step-ahead prediction can provide more information and predict the longer trend of traffic speed than single-step-ahead prediction. This paper presents a multi-step-ahead traffic speed prediction approach by improving the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT). The traditional multiple output strategies, e.g., the direct strategy and iterated strategy, share a common feature that they model the samples through multi-input single-output mapping rather than multi-input multi-output mapping. This paper proposes multivariate GBRT to realize simultaneous multiple outputs by considering correlations of the outputs which have not been fully considered in the existing strategies. For illustrative purposes, traffic detection data are extracted at the 5-min aggregation time interval from three loop detectors in US101-N freeway through the Performance Measurement System (PeMS). The support vector regression (SVR) is used as the benchmark. Assessments on the three models are based on the three criteria, i.e., prediction accuracy, prediction stability, and prediction time. The results indicate that (I) Multivariate GBRT and GBRT using the direct strategy have higher prediction accuracies compared with SVR; (II) GBRT using the iterated strategy has a good prediction accuracy in short-step-ahead prediction and the prediction accuracy decreases significantly in long-step-ahead prediction; (III) Multivariate GBRT has the best stability which means the higher reliability in multi-step-ahead prediction while iterated GBRT has the worst stability; and (IV) Multivariate GBRT has an enormous advantage in the prediction efficiency and this advantage will expand with the increasing prediction horizons."

In this study, radio frequency identification (RFID) data collected in Nanjing (a major city in southern China) were used to estimate dynamic travel demands and develop an RFID data-based vehicle routing model that simultaneously considers individual benefits and social good. The proposed vehicle routing model also used information regarding driver origins that contribute to major congestion; therefore, the routing model can be applied to a group of targeted vehicles only, providing more adaptive, efficient, and feasible routing strategies to mitigate traffic congestion."
15472450.2019.1614445,"This evaluation ascertained the operational impacts of the SUTRAC (Scalable Urban Traffic Control) Adaptive Signal Control Technology (ASCT) in an urban corridor consisting of 23 intersections in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A combination of real-world GPS floating car runs and private sector probe data from INRIX was used to assess the impact of the ASCT. Data were collected with the ASCT active and inactive to determine the operational impacts on the mainline and cross streets. The ASCT was found to produce significant improvements in the number of stops made along the corridor. On Baum and Center, travel times improved during the AM and PM peak in the WB direction. Speeds were also observed to improve significantly during the Midday period on Baum EB and during the AM and PM peak periods on Baum WB. Similarly, statistically significant improvements in speed were observed on Center WB during the AM and PM periods, while a statistically significant decrease in speed was observed during the Midday period. Six months of private sector probe data was used to examine travel time reliability along the corridor, and reliability was also found to have improved. Further, Bayesian models were calibrated to account for variations in speeds and acceleration/deceleration. The Bayesian models revealed that driving was less volatile with the ASCT system in operation over instantaneous periods, which also points towards improved operations. The findings of this study are generally consistent with past evaluations of other ASCTs, indicating that the SURTRAC system is another potential tool for managing congestion on signalized urban arterial networks."

Moreover, our simulation shows that the proposed scheme is well designed and efficient."
15472450.2019.1643723,"In a connected vehicle environment, vehicle location, speed, and other traffic information are readily available; hence, such environments provide new data sources for traffic signal control optimization. Existing adaptive signal control systems based on fixed detectors cannot directly obtain vehicle location and speed information, and thus, cannot provide accurate information about real-time traffic flow changes. This study presents a dynamic optimization method for adaptive signal control in a connected vehicle environment. First, the proposed method developed a dynamic platoon dispersion model to predict vehicle arrivals by using connected vehicle data. Then, a signal timing optimization model is constructed by regarding the minimization of average vehicle delay as the optimization objective, and setting the green time duration of each phase as a constraint. To achieve real-time adaptive signal control, a genetic algorithm is adopted to solve the optimization model through rolling optimization. Finally, a real-world road network was modeled in Vissim to validate the proposed method. Simulation results show that compared with the classical adaptive signal control algorithm, the proposed method is able to reduce vehicle delays and queue lengths at least 50% penetration rates. At 100% penetration rate, the proposed method improved the average vehicle delay and the average queue length by 22.7% and 24.8%, respectively. Moreover, it catered to all directions in a balanced manner."
15472450.2019.1659793,"Truck weight data is needed for a wide range of applications including but not limited to pavement design, weight enforcement, traffic monitoring, and freight transportation planning. Unfortunately, the low spatial resolution of weight sensors along the transportation network can limit these and other potential applications. The main contribution of this paper is a methodology to estimate gross vehicle weight (GVW) distributions at traffic count sites, which collect traffic volumes but currently do not have the ability to directly measure vehicle weight. This paper presents a method for estimating GVW distributions of five-axle tractor-trailers (“3-S2”) at traffic count sites by fuzing weight data from weigh-in-motion (WIM) sites with position data from global positioning system (GPS) equipped trucks. Truck travel patterns derived from a truck GPS database were used to determine the degree to which a WIM and traffic count site are spatially related. A GVW distribution was then estimated by combining Gaussian mixture models (GMM) estimated at WIM sites defined to be spatially related to the traffic count site. A leave-one-out cross validation framework allowed for comparisons of estimated and measured GVW distributions at each WIM site. Coincidence ratios and two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) tests were used as comparison metrics for a case study of 112 WIM sites in California. The proposed methodology provided better goodness-of-fit between observed and estimated GVW distributions compared to a baseline approach which defined the spatial relation between sites using great circle distances (GCD)."

A great deal of global positioning system (GPS) log data and vehicle monitoring data is generated on IoV. When many small files in the conventional Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) are accessed, a series of problems arise such as high occupancy rate, low access efficiency and low retrieval efficiency, which lead to degrade the performance of IoV. In an attempt to tackle these bottleneck problems, a small Files Correlation Probability (FCP) model is proposed, which is based on the Text Feature Vector (TFV) presented in this paper. The Small Files Merge Scheme based on FCP (SFMS-FCP) and the Small File Prefetching and Caching Strategies (SFPCS) are proposed to optimize the storage and access performance of HDFS. Finally, experiments show that the proposed optimization solutions achieve better performance in terms of high occupancy of HDFS name nodes and low access efficiency, compared with the native HDFS read-write scheme and HAR-based read-write optimization scheme."
15472450.2019.1652826,"Artificial intelligence (AI) methods for traffic video analysis have been widely identified as potential solutions for solving hard problems in intelligent transport systems (ITS). To exploit the advantages of AI, dense cameras to monitor the traffic are required to be deployed along the road and at the intersections. The captured videos of these cameras should be back-hauled to the control center, acting as the inputs of the AI methods. To bear such large data traffic load and to cover long transmission range, directional communication technology can be employed, which concentrate the energy of the wireless signal in a specified direction to provide high data rate and long transmission range (up to hundreds of kilometers). In this paper, the communication time extension problem (CTEP) is identified when directional transmission is applied to the dense urban traffic surveillance system, where the wireless signal propagation time approximates the data transmission time. A link distance division-based time division multiple access (LDD-TDMA) protocol is proposed to address the identified CTEP. Firstly, the directional wireless communication links are classified into categories according to the link distance, where nodes located in the same communication ring belong to the same category. Then a link distance aware (LDA)-based slot allocation algorithm is proposed to assign the time slots to the links. The optimal communication rings’ radius is derived in closed form formula, and the minimum average links’ distance is derived. Simulation results show that LDD-TDMA outperforms TDMA by 13.37% when the ring number is 4."
15472450.2019.1643725,"Infrared and visible images play an important role in transportation systems since they can monitor traffic conditions around the clock. However, visible images are susceptible to the imaging environments, and infrared images are not rich enough in detail. The infrared and visible images fusion techniques can fuse these two different modal images into a single image with more useful information. In this paper, we propose an effective infrared and visible images fusion method for traffic systems. The weight maps are measured by utilizing the sparse coefficients. The next is to decompose the infrared and visible pair into high-frequency layers (HFLs) and low-frequency layers (LFLs). Since the two layers contain different structures and texture information, to extract the representative component, the guided filter is utilized to optimize weight maps in accordance with the different characteristic of the infrared and visible pairs. The final step is to reconstruct the two-scale layers according to the weight maps. Experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms other popular approaches in terms of subjective perception and objective metrics."
15472450.2020.1721289,"Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication using Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) technology promises to help drastically reduce vehicle collisions. DSRC allows vehicles in a highly mobile and complex network to send and receive safety messages with more reliability and lower latency compared with other wireless technologies used for automotive communications. However, there are many factors that could cause a safety-critical automotive application to become unreliable due to communication failures. While the reliability of V2V communication has been a subject of study by several researchers, there are still open questions regarding how the placement of the DSRC devices (inside or outside the host vehicle), the vehicle’s interior elements and the differences in altitude can affect the V2V communications. This article provides experimental testing data and analyses in order to quantify the impacts of relative vehicle speeds, altitude differences between vehicles, and interior obstacles on V2V communication range and reliability for opposite traffic, in both city and highway environments. We discuss how these results can adversely affect the design parameters of safety critical applications by considering the V2V application “Safe Pass Advisory” on two-lane rural highways."
15472450.2020.1742121,"We investigates the performance of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing highway traffic congestion state in surveillance camera images. Different from the usual images in ImageNet, images generated by highway surveillance cameras usually have much more extensive range of perspective and thus larger area of background. Therefore the objective road and vehicles are not as prominent as target object in ImageNet images. And also these images from cameras across a large number of highway sites could show a very rich variance of scenes, road configurations. We are very interested to study whether convolutional networks are still reliably able to classify such images, without any special previous processing such as segmentation of objective roads. Two classic convolutional networks, AlexNet and GoogLeNet are employed to classify congestion state. We build a highway imagery dataset using real-life traffic videos to evaluate the CNNs recognition performance. These images cover a wide range of road configurations, times of the day, weather and lighting conditions, and have been labeled with one of the two states, congestion or non-congestion. The experimental results indicate that under the current strategy of feeding images directly into networks, both AlexNet and GoogLeNet can achieve an excellent recognition accuracy of 98% on held-out test samples. And many of the misclassified images turn out to be borderline cases. More results include that scale and perspective in photography could affect the recognition result."
15472450.2019.1642753,"Infrared imaging sensors are widely employed in urban traffic systems since they are not affected by lighting conditions. However, due to the limitation of hardware and imaging environment, it is difficult to obtain infrared (IR) images at the desired quality. IR images always lack detailed information, which leads to unsatisfying IR image enhancement results with the conventional method. Compared with the IR images, the visible (VIS) images contain detailed information, which could help to enhance the quality of the corresponding IR images. In this article, we propose an effective method to enhance IR images by applying the multi-sensors image. First, we adopt the edge-preserving filter to decompose the IR and VIS images into illumination and reflectance components according to Retinex theory. Second, each region in the IR and VIS image is classified into the related region and non-related region according to the correlation between IR and VIS images. Finally, an adaptive fuzzy plateau HE (AFPHE) is utilized to enhance the illumination component, and a strategy is employed to enhance the detail of the IR reflectance component with the help of VIS images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve the contrast and enhance the detail of the IR images."

Although modern video coding standards have significantly improved the video coding efficiency, they are designed for general video rather than surveillance video. The special characteristics of surveillance video leave a large space for further performance improvement. In this paper, we leverage a deep learning approach to enhance the quality of compressed surveillance video. More specifically, we formulate the problem of frame enhancement as a regression problem and design a Residual Squeeze-and-Excitation Network (RSE-Net), to address it. RSE-Net extensively exploits the non-linear mapping between the reconstructed frame and the ground truth, with only a small number of parameters. Moreover, By improving You Only Look Once (YOLO) network, we successfully detect the grouped vehicles within a frame. A novel model training scheme is then developed through learning from the grouped vehicles. With the proposed scheme, we train a global model for both foreground and background of surveillance video. Experimental results show that our method achieves average 0.40 dB, 0.22 dB and 0.24 dB PSNR gains over H.265/HEVC anchor in AI, LDP and RA configurations, and produces visually pleasing results when applied to compressed surveillance video."
15472450.2019.1638782,"Wrong way driving (WWD) crashes on high-speed limited access facilities often cause severe injuries and deaths. Conventional “Wrong Way” signs can reduce WWD events but can be insufficient in some cases. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) WWD countermeasures can more effectively notify wrong-way drivers of their mistake. This paper compares the safety performance of two types of ITS WWD countermeasures implemented in Florida: Light-Emitting Diode (LED) signs in South Florida (which include one set of signs and one camera) and Rectangular Flashing Beacon (RFB) signs in Central Florida (which include two sets of signs and three cameras). The reduction in WWD events (911 calls and citations) and the percentage of wrong-way drivers who self-corrected their WWD behavior were used as surrogate safety performance measures instead of crashes, since WWD crashes are rare. Chi-squared tests revealed a significant reduction in WWD events at the LED and RFB treated sites compared to control sites without these countermeasures. Comparison group analyses indicated that the LED and RFB countermeasures reduced WWD events by 48.1% and 69.4%, respectively. Additionally, photographs taken by cameras on the countermeasures and/or closed-circuit television cameras monitored by the traffic management centers showed that over 16% of the 72 detected wrong-way vehicles self-corrected at the LED sites and 81% of the 353 detected wrong-way vehicles self-corrected at the RFB sites. The methods and results in this paper can help transportation agencies throughout the United States identify the most suitable WWD countermeasures and evaluate their performance."
15472450.2019.1638780,"In this article, we discuss the system-optimum dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA) problem in the presence of time-dependent uncertainties on both traffic demands and road link capacities. Building on an earlier formulation of the problem based on the cell transmission model, the SO-DTA problem is robustly solved, in a probabilistic sense, within the framework of random convex programs (RCPs). Different from traditional robust optimization schemes, which find a solution that is valid for all the values of the uncertain parameters, in the RCP approach we use a fixed number of random realizations of the uncertainty, and we are able to guarantee a priori a desired upper bound on the probability that a new, unseen realization of the uncertainty would make the computed solution unfeasible. The particular problem structure and the introduction of an effective domination criterion for discarding a large number of generated samples enables the computation of a robust solution for medium- to large-scale networks, with low desired violation probability, with a moderate computational effort. The proposed approach is quite general and applicable to any problem that can be formulated through a linear programing model, where the stochastic parameters appear in the constraint constant terms only. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of our approach."

Considering the increased vulnerability of MTW riders in dense urban systems, proper evaluation and modeling of pore acceptance/rejection predictions of MTWs can essentially provide a safer driving environment to MTW riders and the surrounding vehicles in a cognitive architecture, augment the reliability and predictability of microsimulation models and ameliorate the overall traffic flow phenomena. The current study therefore investigates the applicability of Raff’s method, binary logit model and support vector machines (SVM) in predicting the pore acceptance decisions of MTW riders during filtering in urban mid-block sections. The results of the study suggested that SVM technique could be considered as a potential tool for estimating the pore acceptance and rejection predictions of MTW riders, which can be further implemented in a cooperative intelligent transport systems environment for an overall safe yet smooth flow of traffic."
