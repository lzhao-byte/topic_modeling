For this purpose, Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver is the main sensor. However, the use of GPS alone is not sufficient in many urban environments. GPS has to be helped with dead-reckoned sensors, map data, and cameras. A novel observation of the absolute pose of the vehicle is proposed to back up GPS and the drift of dead-reckoned sensors. This approach uses a new source of information that is a geographical 3-dimensional (3D) model of the environment in which the vehicle navigates. This virtual 3D city model is managed in real time by a 3D geographical information system (3D GIS). This pose's observation is constructed by matching the virtual image provided by the 3D GIS and the real image acquired by an onboard camera. An extended Kalman filter combines the sensors measurements to produce an estimation of the vehicle's pose. Experimental results using data from an odometer, a gyroscope, a GPS receiver, a camera, and an accurate geographical 3D model of the environment illustrate the developed approach.",this article tackles the problem of a vehicles geolocalization in urban areas for this purpose global positioning system  receiver is the main sensor however the use of gps alone is not sufficient in many urban environments gps has to be helped with deadreckoned sensors map data and cameras a novel observation of the absolute pose of the vehicle is proposed to back up gps and the drift of deadreckoned sensors this approach uses a new source of information that is a geographical dimensional  model of the environment in which the vehicle navigates this virtual d city model is managed in real time by a d geographical information system  this poses observation is constructed by matching the virtual image provided by the d gis and the real image acquired by an onboard camera an extended kalman filter combines the sensors measurements to produce an estimation of the vehicles pose experimental results using data from an odometer a gyroscope a gps receiver a camera and an accurate geographical d model of the environment illustrate the developed approach

In this article, the authors present a framework to detect road features in 2 difficult situations: (a) ambiguous road surface conditions (i.e., damaged roads and occluded lane markings caused by the presence of other vehicles on the road) and (b) poor illumination conditions (e.g., backlight, during sunset). Furthermore, to understand the lane number that a driver is driving on, the authors present a Bayesian network (BN) model, which is necessary to support more sophisticated navigation services for drivers such as recommending lane change at an appropriate time before turning left or right at the next intersection. In the proposed BN approach, evidence from (1) a computer vision engine (e.g., lane-color detection) and (2) a navigation database (e.g., the total number of lanes) was fused to more accurately decide the lane number.

Numerous studies have been conducted to estimate travel times on the basis of data from loop detectors. This article focuses on evaluating the performance of a set of estimation methods—algorithms that estimate route travel times using specific speed data from dual loop detectors for real-time applications, such as displaying travel times on changeable message signs. The travel-time estimates are evaluated against probe vehicle data obtained from FasTrak in the San Francisco Bay Area to determine the accuracy of the estimates. The study reveals that (a) the dispersion of travel time is often larger in off-peak periods than in peak periods for heavily congested freeways; (b) assessed against the same set of speed data, the evaluated algorithms have similar performance; (c) the accuracy of travel-time estimates on the basis of loop-detector data is better in off-peak periods than in peak periods; (d) lane-by-lane speeds from loop detectors may be used to improve travel time estimation; and (e) travel time estimation quality is more sensitive to actual sensor locations if sensors are sparse.",travel time for an itinerary constitutes one of the most relevant roadway traffic metrics numerous studies have been conducted to estimate travel times on the basis of data from loop detectors this article focuses on evaluating the performance of a set of estimation methodsalgorithms that estimate route travel times using specific speed data from dual loop detectors for realtime applications such as displaying travel times on changeable message signs the traveltime estimates are evaluated against probe vehicle data obtained from fastrak in the san francisco bay area to determine the accuracy of the estimates the study reveals that  the dispersion of travel time is often larger in offpeak periods than in peak periods for heavily congested freeways;  assessed against the same set of speed data the evaluated algorithms have similar performance;  the accuracy of traveltime estimates on the basis of loopdetector data is better in offpeak periods than in peak periods;  lanebylane speeds from loop detectors may be used to improve travel time estimation; and  travel time estimation quality is more sensitive to actual sensor locations if sensors are sparse

The objective is to enhance the conventional single-class cell transmission model (S-CTM) to a more generalized multiclass cell transmission model (M-CTM). This latter model can take into account the mixed composition of vehicle classes (i.e., with distinct free-flow speed and vehicle length). The aim is to introduce head-of-cell and end-of-cell vehicles into the model. Cascading, merging, and diverging scenarios of cells for M-CTM have been formulated so that the model can be applied to a general topology of road network. Experimental results are provided to compare S-CTM and M-CTM in 6 network test cases with the microscopic simulator—MITSIM—and to actual measurement of network traffic conditions. The results suggest that M-CTM is significantly more accurate than S-CTM in the tested networks with nonstationary vehicle composition, with platoon dispersions and with time-varying jam status. In addition, accuracy improvement of M-CTM is obtained without compromising the computational complexity.

Such an approach is costly because it requires installation of a system before potential benefits can be observed. Nowadays to investigate effectiveness of many alternatives that were traditionally investigated in field, microsimulation is used. However, how much can one rely on results from microsimulation? There has not been a single study in which benefits of adaptive traffic control systems measured in the field are compared with those obtained through microsimulation. This study presents such a research effort. The authors compared performance measures from a field evaluation of Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System in Park City, Utah, to their counterparts from microsimulation. They collected a significant amount of data to assess system performance in the field and to help build a microsimulation model. A 14-intersection model of the Park City network was developed, calibrated, and validated on the basis of multiple data sources. The results show that a validated microsimulation model can accurately reflect field conditions although such an effort can be very challenging.",usually benefits from deploying an adaptive traffic control system are measured by comparing data collected in the field before the system is installed with those collected after the system is fully operational such an approach is costly because it requires installation of a system before potential benefits can be observed nowadays to investigate effectiveness of many alternatives that were traditionally investigated in field microsimulation is used however how much can one rely on results from microsimulation there has not been a single study in which benefits of adaptive traffic control systems measured in the field are compared with those obtained through microsimulation this study presents such a research effort the authors compared performance measures from a field evaluation of sydney coordinated adaptive traffic system in park city utah to their counterparts from microsimulation they collected a significant amount of data to assess system performance in the field and to help build a microsimulation model a intersection model of the park city network was developed calibrated and validated on the basis of multiple data sources the results show that a validated microsimulation model can accurately reflect field conditions although such an effort can be very challenging

This article addresses two questions. First, in a one mode world (e.g., rail or road), what is the optimal capacity choice when faced with uncertain demand, long lead times, and congestion. Using a simple analytical model, it is shown that when demand is inelastic, it is socially optimal to invest more than if only the expected level of demand is taken into account. In this case, it may be beneficial to overinvest in capacity because congestion costs are an increasing function of relative use. This result holds with or without optimal tolling. The second question deals with 2 competing modes in which only one mode has long lead times for capacity, whereas the other has flexible capacity. This is typical for the competition between high-speed rail and air for the medium distance trips (500–1,000 km), or for the competition between inland waterways and trucks for freight. We find that overinvestment is less justified because the substitute mode can more easily absorb the high-demand outcomes.",in transportation planning there can be long lead times to adapt capacity this article addresses two questions first in a one mode world  what is the optimal capacity choice when faced with uncertain demand long lead times and congestion using a simple analytical model it is shown that when demand is inelastic it is socially optimal to invest more than if only the expected level of demand is taken into account in this case it may be beneficial to overinvest in capacity because congestion costs are an increasing function of relative use this result holds with or without optimal tolling the second question deals with  competing modes in which only one mode has long lead times for capacity whereas the other has flexible capacity this is typical for the competition between highspeed rail and air for the medium distance trips  or for the competition between inland waterways and trucks for freight we find that overinvestment is less justified because the substitute mode can more easily absorb the highdemand outcomes

If road haulers choose to load their truck on a train, they are not able to switch to using the road again until they reach the end of the line. On the contrary, highway choice is flexible in that the road hauler can change road at any time. Building upon the irreversibility of one of the two choices, the authors build a model in which traffic levels are risky using both infrastructures. In the model, they found that haulers' choices depend on the infrastructure price for railways and on the information level obtained by the hauler during travel. The flexible option is more valuable the more informed the agent is about traffic levels. These theoretical predictions are tested by implementing two experimental treatments. In the first, agents gain no information during their travel; in the second they become perfectly informed about traffic conditions during the travel. It is important that experimental payoffs are calibrated upon transport data about time and operating costs and infrastructure tariffs in France. From the experiment, the authors found that more risk-averse agents assign more value to the flexible option. The second result is that participants overreact to infrastructure price changes. The results indicate that, as the model stands, price levels and information level are important explanatory variables of choice. The higher the price is for railways and the higher the information is, the more participants give value to flexible option (highway), especially if participants are risk averse.

Second, it enables the use of observed information acquisition behavior for the estimation of travel related parameters (e.g., value of time). Third, its parameters are easily interpretable. The formulation is tested using data from a multimodal travel simulator with information provision. Estimation results provide face validity to the formulation. Results indicate that travelers on non–business trips attach particular importance to mean travel times, whereas during business trips travel time variability also plays an important role.

Because travel-time decisions are made from momentary recollections of past experience, the paradigm adopted in this study is that the mode travel time rather than the mean is the important basis for travel time decisions. The authors then explore three alternate measures of reliability and use them to estimate route choice models on the basis of the stated preference data. Two of the measures, range coupled with lateness probability and standard deviation, have been explored before. A third measure based on time moment (moments of inertia) measured from the mode travel time is also proposed and tested.

Furthermore, it examines the calibration and validation of the ITS Modeller for congestion caused by a lane drop using traffic flow measurements on a segment of the Dutch A12 highway. Simulation experiments of different penetration rates and system settings show that the stop and go leads to a 30% decrease in travel-time delay at a 10% penetration rate, while the active pedal leads to small reductions in travel-time delay. Compared with the stop-and-go function, the active pedal has fewer sharp accelerations and decelerations, which implies better traffic safety and driver comfort. The effect of the stop-and-go active pedal combination is similar to that of the stop-and-go function on its own.

Such signs are part of advanced traveler information systems, and they can help drivers make better en route decisions regarding their trips. Unlike most other ITS elements (e.g., ramp metering, advanced signals), VMSs are not supported by mandatory regulations. Consequently, the expected benefit from implementing VMSs largely depends on the response of drivers. This study explored the factors affecting alternative route choices of car drivers with VMSs on the interstate highway system. This study adopted a method called LOTUS to analyze driver-compliance behavior with VMSs. Driver behavior under information provision through VMS data has been collected using the stated-preference approach.

The reidentification model when applied to a test data set (where each downstream vehicle also crosses the upstream site) matches vehicles with an accuracy of 91% when both axle weight and axle spacings data are used. To account for the fact that not all vehicles in the downstream also cross the upstream site, an additional new step is developed to screen mismatched vehicles produced by the algorithm. For this step, several screening methods are developed that allow the user to trade off the total number of matched vehicles and error rate. For evaluating the effectiveness of the screening methods, 2 scenarios are considered. In the first scenario, only common vehicles that cross both the upstream and downstream sites are considered, whereas in the second scenario all downstream vehicles are considered.

Such algorithms map a new GPS positioning point instantaneously given its historical points and network topology. Using high-logging frequency data-based map-matching algorithms for low-logging frequency data can cause several problems. First, large mapping errors in previous GPS points can easily propagate to the current points. Second, one-point-a-time processing is not effective and not necessary for traffic monitoring. Multiple GPS points can be processed together to determine routes more effectively. In this article, the authors propose a map-matching framework for low-logging frequency GPS probe data.

Despite the important effect of traffic flow on bus travel time, previous predictive approaches have not fully considered a traffic measure making their predictions unresponsive to the dynamic changes in traffic congestion. In addition, existing methodologies have primarily concerned predicting average travel time given a certain set of input values. However, predicting travel-time variability has not received sufficient attention in previous research. This article proposes an integrated framework to predict bus average travel time and its variability on the basis of a range of input variables including traffic flow data. The framework is applied using GPS-based travel-time data for a bus route in Melbourne, Australia, in conjunction with dynamic traffic flow data collected by the Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic Systems loop detectors and a measure of schedule adherence. Central to the framework are two artificial neural networks that are used to predict the average and variance of travel times for a certain set of input values. The outcomes are then used to construct a prediction interval corresponding to each input value set. The article demonstrates the ability of the proposed framework to provide robust prediction intervals.

E-screening is known to add significant efficiency in operating weigh stations by allowing eligible trucks to bypass the in-station inspection, hence reducing the congestion at the weigh station. The primary goal of this study was twofold: (a) to develop a simulation model for describing the e-screening operation at truck weigh stations and (b) to analyze and evaluate the weigh station operation with varying values of affecting factors including the transponder penetration rate and the weigh-in-motion weight threshold. This study focuses the e-screening operation at a small weigh station with relatively short queuing area and heavy truck volumes, which is inevitably vulnerable to truck overflows and is sensitive to the prevailing transponder penetration rate and the weigh-in-motion threshold. The simulation results reveal that an e-screening operation can substantially improve the overweight enforcement and can reduce the travel time of legal trucks passing the test weigh station. The simulation results also demonstrate that properly adjusted weigh-in-motion thresholds can effectively enhance the overweight enforcement by preventing overweight trucks from being granted a false green light as a result of the erroneous weigh-in-motion measurement error.

A review of the current literature offers several ITS investment evaluation methods that provide frameworks for the quantification of risks and benefits. Nevertheless, the traditional selection methods overemphasize quantitative and economic analysis and often neglect to consider qualitative and noneconomic data in the formal selection process. Furthermore, crisp data are fundamentally indispensable in traditional ITS investment selection methods. However, the data in real-world problems are often imprecise or ambiguous.

Most such agencies still seek additional guidelines for the selection of suitable wireless options for different traffic control and management applications under different physical and environmental conditions. Performance and reliability are among the most important parameters to be considered when examining wireless communication options for traffic control and management applications. The authors first conducted interviews with selected traffic agencies regarding their experiences with performance of wireless communication infrastructure, as well as their interests and plans on future expansion. Next, they conducted a thorough literature review focusing on various wireless technologies that could be used in an intelligent transportation system environment. Last, the authors conducted a case study in which a section of the South Carolina Department of Transportation traffic camera system was wirelessly connected via either WiFi or WiMAX network architecture. This case study followed the proposed network design process presented in the article using WiFi and WiMAX technologies to support a traffic surveillance system that considered coverage range and two different network topologies: mesh/ad hoc (devices forward data to neighboring devices to reach the destination) and infrastructure (devices send data to an access point directly). The network simulator ns-2 was used to assess the average throughput that each camera can receive in different network topologies. Throughput/cost analysis of WiFi and WiMAX mesh and infrastructure topologies indicated that for given number of devices, a mesh network has better throughput for every dollar spent than infrastructure based topology. This article provides a foundation for further investigation of WiFi and WiMAX performance and reliability under different network topologies.

However, as a result of high speed and variable driver behavior, automotive ad-hoc networks behave in fundamentally different ways to the most prevalent models in Mobile Ad-Hoc Network (MANET) research. Previous work in MANETs has mostly assumed that the mobile nodes move randomly with an unconstrained mobility model, and it is clear that a random mobility model is not adequate to represent the major characteristics of real-world vehicle motions and may therefore lead to unreliable results. Recent studies of VANETs have attempted to introduce macro- and micromobility constraints to model vehicle motions, but they have mostly focused on modeling the mobility of generic private vehicles. Given the potential for the coordinated deployment of network nodes on centrally managed fleet vehicles, it has become important to model the characteristics of a VANET featuring vehicles of different types, with systematically different behavior patterns. In this article, the authors study the connectivity of mobile ad-hoc networks that consist of buses moving in urban area and examine the implications for transport-related services. Buses have a unique set of behavior characteristics (e.g., fixed routes, schedules, bus stops, specific priorities), which gives rise to distinct effect on node connectivity in the communication network. Through extensive simulations on the basis of real bus routes in central London, the authors (a) demonstrated the effect of the locations of stops and the prevailing traffic patterns on node connectivity (including the distributions of contact duration and intercontact time between buses) and (b) explored its implication on the design of a dissemination system to capture and disseminate data. Their results give a key message that the mobility of buses has to be modeled explicitly, and such kind of knowledge of connectivity among buses will be significant for the studies of routing algorithms and other networking functions in interbus communication networks.",vehicular adhoc networks  attract considerable research and commercial interest with promising applications in a number of areas including cooperative vehiclehighways systems sensor networks and safety systems however as a result of high speed and variable driver behavior automotive adhoc networks behave in fundamentally different ways to the most prevalent models in mobile adhoc network  research previous work in manets has mostly assumed that the mobile nodes move randomly with an unconstrained mobility model and it is clear that a random mobility model is not adequate to represent the major characteristics of realworld vehicle motions and may therefore lead to unreliable results recent studies of vanets have attempted to introduce macro and micromobility constraints to model vehicle motions but they have mostly focused on modeling the mobility of generic private vehicles given the potential for the coordinated deployment of network nodes on centrally managed fleet vehicles it has become important to model the characteristics of a vanet featuring vehicles of different types with systematically different behavior patterns in this article the authors study the connectivity of mobile adhoc networks that consist of buses moving in urban area and examine the implications for transportrelated services buses have a unique set of behavior characteristics  which gives rise to distinct effect on node connectivity in the communication network through extensive simulations on the basis of real bus routes in central london the authors  demonstrated the effect of the locations of stops and the prevailing traffic patterns on node connectivity  and  explored its implication on the design of a dissemination system to capture and disseminate data their results give a key message that the mobility of buses has to be modeled explicitly and such kind of knowledge of connectivity among buses will be significant for the studies of routing algorithms and other networking functions in interbus communication networks

This may result in errors in complicated situations such as at Y-junctions, and entrance or exit ramps of a highway. The trajectory-based map-matching algorithm, which determines the matching road by comparing the vehicle trajectory against candidate roads, has the potential to overcome this limitation. However, the curve-to-curve matching as a simple form of trajectory-based map-matching fails to address this. The key issue of a trajectory-based map-matching algorithm is how to evaluate the similarity between the trajectory and the possible traveling roads. This article develops a synthetic fuzzy evaluation method to address the issue. The similarities are quantified in terms of location, shape, direction, and behavior. As a new input in map-matching, vehicle behavior refers to changes in the motion of the vehicle such as turning, which is restrained by the geometry of traveling road. The article also proposes a multilevel fuzzy synthetic evaluation process to assess the similarities and hierarchically synthesize them into a final evaluation. The method is evaluated using GPS positions recorded with a vehicle traveling in the urban area of Beijing, China.

The proposed control scheme dynamically updates green allocation to keep queues on all approaches well balanced. Different from fully dynamic control strategies, the proposed quasi-dynamic scheme is based on a finite set of fixed timing plans with a common cycle length. The decision of switching from one plan to another is made at the beginning of each cycle based on the queue state in the previous cycle. Our experimental results showed that the performance of the proposed scheme is robust with respect to random fluctuation, systematic changes in demand, and input data quality. Although the proposed scheme does not attempt to minimize total system delay directly, it provides a good solution for reducing total system delay compared with the signal timing plan optimized for system delay.

Then, extensions deal with decentralized routing, with enroute planning, intervehicle communication, and with a market-based approach where the manager of the service runs an auction to determine which customer to serve. All these variants aim at testing alternatives in order to shed light onto questions such as how the podcar service is to be provided and how trips have to be planned, as well as address challenges related to the management.

One can say that a coordinated braking strategy B is more beneficial than a strategy A, if strategy B leads to a larger reduction in the probability of a collision, the expected number of collisions, and the expected relative velocity at impact as compared to strategy A. We consider an emergency braking scenario, in which the lead vehicle brakes at its maximum capability and the following vehicles coordinate their braking. The sequence of maximum braking capability (i.e., deceleration) of vehicles in the platoon is assumed to be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables; this distribution is assumed to be discrete and known. Due to coordination among vehicles, however, the “effective” deceleration of a following vehicle may not necessarily be its maximum value. The problem of assessing the benefits of coordination can be formulated as three subproblems. The first subproblem deals with determining the probability distribution of the “effective” deceleration of following vehicles during emergency braking. It is intuitive that the smaller the variance of this distribution, the greater the safety benefits are. We define three metrics of safety through the concept of a violation. A violation occurs in a platoon if the “effective” deceleration of a following vehicle is smaller than that of its predecessor. The second subproblem deals with determining the probability of occurrence of a violation, expected number of violations, and the expected relative velocity corresponding to a possible collision as a function of the difference in the braking capabilities of successive vehicles in a platoon.

In order to develop effective intelligent transportation systems (ITS) strategies to mitigate traffic congestion on freeways, a good understanding of its causes and impacts is vital but has not been achieved at a satisfactory level. Over the past several decades, deterministic queuing theory (DQT) has been widely used to evaluate freeway travel delays resulted from traffic congestion. However, several studies evaluated the accuracy of its delay estimates and claimed that the DQT method consistently underestimates vehicle delays. The reason for the underestimation, however, had not been clearly identified. This study aims at exploring the main cause of such underestimation problems and proposing a solution to fix it. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical justification, it was found the underestimation resulted primarily from the inappropriate estimates of the time offsets, that is, the travel times between the queue starting point and the immediate upstream and downstream traffic sensor locations. To address this issue, a microscopic approach was developed and implemented in a computer application to enhance the time offset estimation. This proposed approach was tested using the real vehicle delay data manually extracted from traffic surveillance video cameras. The test results indicated that the improved DQT-based vehicle delay estimates with appropriate time offset settings were very close to the ground-truth data. The underestimation problem associated with the traditional DQT method can be effectively addressed and fairly accurate estimates of vehicle delay can be achieved by the proposed method.",traffic congestion is getting worse and has resulted in increased travel delays and costs in order to develop effective intelligent transportation systems  strategies to mitigate traffic congestion on freeways a good understanding of its causes and impacts is vital but has not been achieved at a satisfactory level over the past several decades deterministic queuing theory  has been widely used to evaluate freeway travel delays resulted from traffic congestion however several studies evaluated the accuracy of its delay estimates and claimed that the dqt method consistently underestimates vehicle delays the reason for the underestimation however had not been clearly identified this study aims at exploring the main cause of such underestimation problems and proposing a solution to fix it based on theoretical analysis and empirical justification it was found the underestimation resulted primarily from the inappropriate estimates of the time offsets that is the travel times between the queue starting point and the immediate upstream and downstream traffic sensor locations to address this issue a microscopic approach was developed and implemented in a computer application to enhance the time offset estimation this proposed approach was tested using the real vehicle delay data manually extracted from traffic surveillance video cameras the test results indicated that the improved dqtbased vehicle delay estimates with appropriate time offset settings were very close to the groundtruth data the underestimation problem associated with the traditional dqt method can be effectively addressed and fairly accurate estimates of vehicle delay can be achieved by the proposed method

There are two important features in tourists’ decision-making processes: (1) They generally have limited information and experiences on tour sites, and (2) their value of time is higher than normal travelers' because of their time limitations. These two features are, however, the main reasons that make tour information services attractive to tourists and thus should also be incorporated into a modeling framework for investigating the effects of the real-time tour information system. This study develops an agent-based simulation model that incorporates activity chaining behavior into tour scheduling systems. The underlying assumption used in the model is that tourists schedule their activities within their time and budget constraints to maximize their utilities.

Due to errors in positioning sensors, digital maps, and the map-matching (MM) process, MM algorithms sometimes fail to identify the correct road segment from the candidate segments. This phenomenon is known as mismatching. Identification of the wrong road link may mislead users and degrade the performance of a location-based intelligent transportation system (ITS) and services. The main objective of this article is to improve a topological map-matching (tMM) algorithm by error detection, correction, and performance re-evaluation. Errors in a tMM algorithm were determined using data comprising 62,887 positioning points collected in three different countries (the United Kingdom, the United States, and India). After map-matching, each mismatched case was examined to identify the primary causes of the mismatches. A number of strategies were developed and applied to reduce the risk of mismatching thus enhancing the tMM algorithm. An independent data set of 5,256 positioning points collected in and around Nottingham, UK, was employed to re-evaluate the performance of the enhanced tMM algorithm. The original tMM algorithm correctly identified the vehicle's position 96.5% of the time; after enhancement this increased to 97.8%. This compares very well with the performance of tMM algorithms reported in the literature. The enhanced tMM algorithm developed in this research is simple, fast, efficient, and easy to implement.

To comprehensively compare the procedures, systematic and random-error evaluations are conducted for two detector stations with distinct lane configurations. Lane configuration is important for spatial correction methods, which perform well under certain detector failure combinations. The random-error evaluation indicates that temporal correction performs better at all error levels and spatial approaches are inaccurate under light traffic conditions, especially when estimates are based on zero flow readings.

However, they cannot be measured directly by single-loop detectors, the most widely deployed type of traffic sensor in the existing roadway infrastructure. In this study, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-based approach is developed to estimate more accurate traffic speeds and classified vehicle volumes using single-loop outputs. The estimation procedure consists of multiple iterations of parameter correction and validation. After the GMM is established to empirically model vehicle on-times measured by single-loop detectors, the optimal solution can be initially sought to separate length-based vehicle volume data. Based on the on-time of the separated short vehicles from the GMM, an iterative process will be conducted to improve traffic speed and classified volume estimation until the estimation results become statistically stable and converge. This method is straightforward and computationally efficient. The effectiveness of the proposed approach was examined using data collected from several loop stations on Interstate 90 in the Seattle area. The traffic volume data for three vehicle classes are categorized based on the proposed method.

Truck processing time has traditionally been collected for short periods of time (e.g., a few hours) through field observation. From the surveillance cameras widely available at terminal gates, researchers have attempted to collect truck processing time data by manually reviewing camera images frame by frame. However, this manual review process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This study is motivated by the need for effectively collecting truck processing times over a long period of time. An image-processing algorithm to automatically extract truck processing time data using the low-frame-rate images (less than 1 frame per second, fps) is first proposed. The proposed algorithm includes three steps: (1) design of two region of interest (ROIs) per lane to capture truck trajectories, (2) a frame-differencing change-detection algorithm addressing the low frame rate and cast shadow issue, and (3) a unique state transition model with a set of decision rules, considering perspective occlusion and other potential sources of false positive detections, to reliably detect truck departures.

Several features distinguish this study from previous reported research. First, the research utilizes a realistic case study of a medium-sized metropolitan area in the United States. Second, the research applies the latest state-of-the-art models on both the transportation and the environmental modeling sides, through the development of an integrated model combining the Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) model and the Multi-Scale Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator model (MOVES). The integrated model is then used to approximate “green user equilibrium,” and to investigate the impact of market penetration on the likely environmental benefits of green routing. Third, the article also proposes a “targeted” traveler selection strategy whereby travelers with the greatest potential to reduce emissions or fuel consumption are selected for rerouting. Results indicate that green routing could result in significant reductions in emissions, but that this naturally comes at the expense of an increased travel time. For one scenario that considered assuming a traffic stream of only passenger cars, green routing resulted in an almost 13% reduction in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, and a corresponding 8% increase in travel time. The results also indicate that tangible emissions reductions are achievable at low to medium market penetration levels for green routing applications, especially when travelers with the largest likely emissions savings are targeted.",this article conducts a realistic assessment using a realworld case study of the likely environmental benefits of an intelligent transportation systems  strategy that provides dynamic route guidance to travelers based on the lowest emission or fuel consumption routes several features distinguish this study from previous reported research first the research utilizes a realistic case study of a mediumsized metropolitan area in the united states second the research applies the latest stateoftheart models on both the transportation and the environmental modeling sides through the development of an integrated model combining the transportation analysis and simulation system  model and the multiscale motor vehicle emissions simulator model  the integrated model is then used to approximate green user equilibrium and to investigate the impact of market penetration on the likely environmental benefits of green routing third the article also proposes a targeted traveler selection strategy whereby travelers with the greatest potential to reduce emissions or fuel consumption are selected for rerouting results indicate that green routing could result in significant reductions in emissions but that this naturally comes at the expense of an increased travel time for one scenario that considered assuming a traffic stream of only passenger cars green routing resulted in an almost  reduction in carbon monoxide  emissions and a corresponding  increase in travel time the results also indicate that tangible emissions reductions are achievable at low to medium market penetration levels for green routing applications especially when travelers with the largest likely emissions savings are targeted

Decision variables are the specific settings of DTM measures. DTM measures have been identified as powerful instruments not only to increase network efficiency, but also to improve externalities. As a result, in the optimization the focus is not only on efficiency, but also on climate, air quality, traffic safety, and noise. These assessment criteria are determined using the output of a dynamic traffic assignment model. This results in a dynamic multi-objective NDP, which is solved as a bilevel optimization problem; it results in a Pareto optimal set. This set provides valuable information for the decision-making process, which would not have been available if the compensation principle would have been chosen in advance. Knowledge obtained by optimization of realistic cases can be used to attain knowledge about incorporation of externalities as an objective when optimizing traffic systems using DTM measures. A case study for a realistic network of the city of Almelo shows that the objectives efficiency, climate, and air quality are mainly aligned and mainly opposed to traffic safety and noise.

An objective function is defined in order to balance the benefits (e.g., reduction of congestion, pollutant emissions and fuel consumption, or increase in traffic safety) and costs (e.g., increase of free flow travel times). This function is generic in its nature, and could be used to assess any type of traffic management strategy. In particular, it is applied to the Barcelona's freeways dynamic speed limit management case study. The results suggest that the social profitability of dynamic speed limit (DSL) management in metropolitan freeways is limited. The main reason for this is the reduced effect of this kind of policy, if isolated in application, in alleviating congestion. It is emphasized that the absolute magnitude of the profitability is highly sensitive to the value given to each one of the social costs. The profitability of the policy would improve if the value of traffic externalities increased in relation to the marginal cost of travel times. A sensitivity analysis with respect to this last cost is presented. The potential synergies of applying DSL strategies jointly with other active traffic management policies should be considered as an issue for further research.",this article evaluates the impacts of dynamic speed limit strategies in metropolitan freeways an objective function is defined in order to balance the benefits  and costs  this function is generic in its nature and could be used to assess any type of traffic management strategy in particular it is applied to the barcelonas freeways dynamic speed limit management case study the results suggest that the social profitability of dynamic speed limit  management in metropolitan freeways is limited the main reason for this is the reduced effect of this kind of policy if isolated in application in alleviating congestion it is emphasized that the absolute magnitude of the profitability is highly sensitive to the value given to each one of the social costs the profitability of the policy would improve if the value of traffic externalities increased in relation to the marginal cost of travel times a sensitivity analysis with respect to this last cost is presented the potential synergies of applying dsl strategies jointly with other active traffic management policies should be considered as an issue for further research

For example, in order to accurately estimate the effect of a certain network change on the total emissions produced by vehicles in the network, assessment of the vehicle fleet composition for each origin–destination pair is required. As a result, problems that optimize nonlocal merit functions become highly difficult to solve. One such problem is finding the optimal deployment of traffic monitoring units.

Probe vehicle data can provide accurate measurements of current traffic speeds and travel times due to their excellent spatial coverage. However, presently probe vehicles are only a small portion of the vehicles that make up all of the traffic in the network. Alternatively, data from conventional loop detectors cover almost all the vehicles that have traveled along a road section, resulting in excellent temporal coverage. Unfortunately, loop detector measurements can be imprecise; their spatial sampling depends on the loop detector spacing, and they typically only represent traffic speed at the location of the detector and not over the entire road segment. With this complementarity in mind, this article explores several data fusion techniques for fusing data from these sources together. All methods are implemented and compared in terms of their ability to fuse data from loop detectors and probe vehicles to accurately estimate freeway traffic speeds.

Measures commonly used for intersection performance evaluations are control delay, queue length, and cycle failure. However, these variables are not directly available from typical configurations of traffic sensors designed for intersection signal control. Collecting vehicle control delay data manually for intersection performance measurement has been a task too time-consuming and labor-intensive to be practical. Video image processors (VIPs) have been increasingly deployed for intersection signal control in recent years. This study aims to use the extra detection capabilities of VIPs for performance monitoring at signalized intersections. Most VIPs can support up to 24 virtual loops, but normally less than half of the virtual loops are used. By properly configuring the spare virtual loops and analyzing the loop measurements, intersection performance can be monitored in real time. In this research, we propose an approach for measuring queue length and vehicle control delay at signalized intersections based on traffic count data collected with traffic sensors. This algorithm has been implemented in a computerized system called In-PerforM. The In-PerforM system was evaluated by both field tests and simulation experiments. Although the VIPs’ counting errors do affect the accuracy of field test results, we still received encouraging results on queue lengths and control delay measurements in both the field tests and simulation experiments.

In this article such a Lagrangian system model for state estimation is used. The approach uses the extended Kalman filtering technique, in which the discretized Lagrangian kinematic wave model with an extension (node models) for network discontinuities is used as the process equation and the average relation between vehicle spacing and speed (the fundamental diagram) is used as the observation equation.

Most parameters of the model are related to traffic control and flows, which can be directly calibrated from observations. The overflow queue distribution provides important parameters in the delay distribution function that have to be calibrated indirectly from traffic measurements, for example, from the measured delays and flows.

The data are used for traffic management and traveler information. Single-loop detectors can only measure flow and occupancy. Although speed is often the most useful metric, it can only be estimated at conventional single-loop detectors. Typically this estimate comes from the quotient of flow and occupancy multiplied by the fixed, assumed average effective vehicle length. This conventional approach is limited because the actual average effective vehicle length will vary from sample to sample. Many researchers have proposed alternatives to address this problem, and although many of the methods work well under normal conditions, there has been limited research into methods that yield reliable estimates under heavy truck traffic. Heavy truck flows may arise as a function of location or time of day, for example, with proximity to a trucking facility or in early mornings when the number of passenger vehicles drops, respectively.

The objectives are improving traffic flow and enhancing road safety. Their success is based on accurate monitoring of two key variables, specifically speed and occupancy. The latter of the two has, to date, received significantly less attention from the scientific community. In this work we present a lightweight method to perform “on-line” occupancy estimation. We first propose three occupancy measurements calculated from data collected by a floating car: vehicle count, percentage of stop time, and headway. We then extend these discrete values to a continuous estimation of occupancy in space and time. The proposed estimators are based on a pairwise linear regression of each of the previously calculated measurements over certain references obtained from other floating cars or magnetic loop detectors. The method has been calibrated and validated under real traffic conditions and data. Despite the ease of implementation, the method is able to reproduce the occupancy values generated by the actual loop detectors, achieving promising results, with estimation errors down to 6.52%, even before multivehicle systems are considered.",advanced traffic management systems rely heavily on technology to perform accurate estimations of the current state of the traffic as well as its shortterm evolution the objectives are improving traffic flow and enhancing road safety their success is based on accurate monitoring of two key variables specifically speed and occupancy the latter of the two has to date received significantly less attention from the scientific community in this work we present a lightweight method to perform online occupancy estimation we first propose three occupancy measurements calculated from data collected by a floating car vehicle count percentage of stop time and headway we then extend these discrete values to a continuous estimation of occupancy in space and time the proposed estimators are based on a pairwise linear regression of each of the previously calculated measurements over certain references obtained from other floating cars or magnetic loop detectors the method has been calibrated and validated under real traffic conditions and data despite the ease of implementation the method is able to reproduce the occupancy values generated by the actual loop detectors achieving promising results with estimation errors down to  even before multivehicle systems are considered

Incident-induced delay (IID) refers to the extra travel delay resulting from incidents on top of the recurrent congestion. Quantifying IID would help people better understand the real cost of incidents, maximize the benefit-cost ratio of investment on incident remedy actions, and develop active traffic management and integrated corridor management strategies. By combining a modified queuing diagram and short-term traffic flow forecasting techniques, this study proposes an approach to estimate the temporal IID for a roadway section, given that the incidents occurs between two traffic flow detectors. The approach separates IID from the total travel delay, estimates IID for each individual incident, and only takes volume as input for IID quantification, avoiding using speed data that are widely involved in previous algorithms yet are less available or prone to poor data quality. Therefore, this approach can be easily deployed to broader ranges where only volume data are available. To verify its estimation accuracy, this study captures two incident videos and extracts ground-truth IID data, which is rarely done by previous studies.

The classical systems in Europe are organized in stations scattered around the city where a person may pick up a vehicle and afterward return it to the same station (round trip). Allowing a person to drop off the vehicle at any station, called one-way system, poses a significant logistics problem because it creates a significant stock imbalance at the stations, which means that there will be times when users will not have a vehicle available for their trip. Previous mathematical programming formulations have tried to overcome this limitation by optimizing trip selection and station location in a city in order to capture the best trips for balancing the system. But there was one main limitation: The users were assumed to be inflexible with respect to their choice of a station, and held to use only the one closest to their origin and destination. If the user is willing to use the second or even the third closest station the user could benefit from using real-time information on vehicle stocks at each station and be able to select the one with available capacity. In this article we extend a previous model for trip selection and station location that takes that aspect into account by considering more vehicle pick-up and drop-off station options and then apply it to a trip origin–destination matrix from the Lisbon region in Portugal. Through the extended formulation we were able to conclude that user flexibility allied with having information on vehicle stocks increases the profit of the company, as people will go directly to a station with a vehicle available, thus making the use of the fleet more efficient.

True traffic state is decomposed to three components, namely, regular traffic pattern, structural deviation, and random fluctuation. Particularly, the structural deviation term reflects the change of true traffic state from regular (historical) pattern, due to unexpected capacity reduction and/or demand variations. A polynomial trend is adopted to describe the temporal evolution of structural deviations across different time intervals. We derive an analytical form of structural deviations in a single bottleneck case based on cumulative flow count diagrams.

However, this framework cannot handle the asymmetric integration between the flow of trucks and cars.

One way to alleviate congestion is to manage the traffic efficiently by applying intelligent transportation systems (ITS). One set of ITS technologies helps in diverting vehicles from congested parts of the network to alternate routes having less congestion. Congestion is often measured by traffic density, which is the number of vehicles per unit stretch of the roadway. Density, being a spatial characteristic, is difficult to measure in the field. Also, the general approach of estimating density from location-based measures may not capture the spatial variation in density. To capture the spatial variation better, density can be estimated using both location-based and spatial data sources using a data fusion approach. The present study uses a Kalman filter to fuse spatial and location-based data for the estimation of traffic density. Subsequently, the estimated data are utilized for predicting density to future time intervals using a time-series regression model.

The aim is to flatten the peak hours by spreading the demand (i.e., assigning it to the shoulders of the peak hour), lowering the peak demand. This not only would reduce societal costs but also can help to minimize the physical requirements.

Such interactive activity leads us to consider intelligent and advanced ways of interaction leading to cars that can adapt to their drivers. In this article, we focus on the adaptive cruise control (ACC) technology that allows a vehicle to automatically adjust its speed to maintain a preset distance from the vehicle in front of it based on the driver’s preferences. Although individual drivers have different driving styles and preferences, current systems do not distinguish among users. We introduce an approach to combine machine learning algorithms with demographic information and behavioral driver models into existing automated assistive systems. This approach can reduce the interactions between drivers and automated systems by adjusting parameters relevant to the operation of these systems based on their specific drivers and context of drive. We also learn when users tend to engage and disengage the automated system. This approach sheds light on the kinds of dynamics that users develop while interacting with automation and can teach us how to improve these systems for the benefit of their users. While generic packages such as Weka were successful in learning drivers’ behavior exclusively based on the ACC’s sensors, we found that improved learning models could be developed by adding information on drivers’ demographics and a previously developed model about different driver types.

Here, we address dynamic routing problems where the load of roads is taken into account dynamically, aiming at the optimization of required travel times. We investigate ant-based algorithms that can handle dynamic routing problems, but suffer from negative emergent effects like road congestions. These negative effects are inherent in the design of ant-based algorithms. In this article we propose an inverse ant-based routing algorithm to (a) maintain the positive features of ant-based algorithms for dynamic routing problems, while (b) avoiding the occurrence of negative emerging effects, like road congestion. We evaluated the performance of the proposed algorithm by comparing its results with two alternative routing algorithms, namely, A*, which is a static routing algorithm, and an iterative approach.

Since the threshold is typically empirical and fixed, it cannot accommodate the dynamic and time-varying traffic patterns and therefore should be adjusted regularly. This article presents a new Markov-process-based DZ protection algorithm, which considers the number of vehicles in DZ (i.e., the state) over time to be a Markov process. At each time step, the algorithm first predicts the future states with the Markov state-transit matrix, then compares them with the current state to determine whether to end the green or not. In this way, the new end-green criterion is not the fixed threshold value but the current state and the prediction with the Markov state-transit matrix. Meanwhile, the Markov matrix is automatically updated whenever the new observed detected state transitions come in. The new algorithms were also evaluated in simulation and the simulation results showed that the new algorithm maintains reliable and effective protection in a dynamic traffic environment.

Travel delays due to incidents are typically estimated for each incident independently. However, when multiple incidents occur on the same stretch of a roadway, treating them independently and ignoring their interactions leads to inaccurate results, which ultimately may lead to inefficient incident management strategies. This study examines delays due to primary–secondary incident pairs that occur on the same stretch of a freeway within a short time gap. Depending on their correlation in time and space, they can have varying degrees of impacts on the traffic flow. This article assesses the total delays induced by primary–secondary incident pairs by jointly modeling their occurrences. First, incident data combined with roadway inventory data from Hampton Roads, Virginia, are analyzed to understand the attributes of primary–secondary incident pairs, e.g., durations, lane blockages, and time gaps (between start times of the primary and its secondary incidents). Then using microscopic simulation as a primary evaluation tool, the effects of three critical parameters are investigated: time gap, distance between primary and secondary incidents, and traffic demand level. The historical incident analysis shows that, on average, primary–secondary incident pairs have substantially longer durations than single incidents. The joint analysis of queuing delays induced by primary incident and its secondary incident suggests that time gap and distance between a primary incident and its secondary incident are significantly associated with the total delays after controlling for other factors (e.g., the two associated incidents’ durations and lane blockages). Furthermore, based on the scenarios tested (i.e., two incidents both blocking the right lane in a three-lane basic freeway section), it is found that the sum of delays induced by a primary incident and its secondary incident separately will over- or underestimate the actual delays. For those secondary incidents that end after their associated primary incidents, total delays increase as time gap increases; increasing the distance between primary and secondary incidents is associated with reduction in delays. Other results and the implications of the findings for traffic operations are presented in the article.",incidents cause substantial travel delays on urban freeways travel delays due to incidents are typically estimated for each incident independently however when multiple incidents occur on the same stretch of a roadway treating them independently and ignoring their interactions leads to inaccurate results which ultimately may lead to inefficient incident management strategies this study examines delays due to primarysecondary incident pairs that occur on the same stretch of a freeway within a short time gap depending on their correlation in time and space they can have varying degrees of impacts on the traffic flow this article assesses the total delays induced by primarysecondary incident pairs by jointly modeling their occurrences first incident data combined with roadway inventory data from hampton roads virginia are analyzed to understand the attributes of primarysecondary incident pairs eg durations lane blockages and time gaps  then using microscopic simulation as a primary evaluation tool the effects of three critical parameters are investigated time gap distance between primary and secondary incidents and traffic demand level the historical incident analysis shows that on average primarysecondary incident pairs have substantially longer durations than single incidents the joint analysis of queuing delays induced by primary incident and its secondary incident suggests that time gap and distance between a primary incident and its secondary incident are significantly associated with the total delays after controlling for other factors  furthermore based on the scenarios tested  it is found that the sum of delays induced by a primary incident and its secondary incident separately will over or underestimate the actual delays for those secondary incidents that end after their associated primary incidents total delays increase as time gap increases; increasing the distance between primary and secondary incidents is associated with reduction in delays other results and the implications of the findings for traffic operations are presented in the article

Urban expressways usually have short spaced ramps, which makes the traffic flow characterizations quite different from the ones of freeways. In addition, expressways usually have heavy traffic flow, which makes it more difficult to distinguish incidents from congestion. This article presents an AID method for urban expressways, using loop detector data. Based on the geometric conditions and detector locations, the expressway is divided into short segments. The equivalent upstream and downstream traffic flow density difference is defined and calculated using the loop detector data.

This depends mainly on the strength and speed of a transmitting device, discovery procedure, location of the device relative to the Bluetooth sensor, the Bluetooth sensor's ping cycle (0.1 s), the size and shape of the sensor's detection zone, and the time span for which the Bluetooth-enabled device is within the detection zone. The influences of size of Bluetooth sensor detection zones and Bluetooth discovery procedure on multiple detection events have been mentioned in previous research. However, their corresponding impacts on accuracy and reliability of estimated travel time have not been evaluated. In this study, a controlled field experiment is conducted to collect both Bluetooth and global positioning system (GPS) data for 1000 trips to be used as the basis for evaluation. Data obtained by GPS logger are used to calculate actual travel time, referred to as ground truth, and to geo-code the Bluetooth detection events. In this setting, reliability is defined as the percentage of devices captured per trip during the experiment. It is found that, on average, Bluetooth-enabled devices will be detected 80% of the time while passing a sensor location. The impact of location ambiguity caused by the size of the detection zone is evaluated using geo-coded Bluetooth data. Results show that more than 80% of the detection events are recorded within the range of 100 m from the sensor center line.

Vehicle classification stations depend on accurate calibration and validation to yield meaningful results. Operating agencies spend millions of dollars to deploy vehicle classification stations to collect classified count data, yet very few of these stations are ever subjected to a rigorous performance evaluation to ensure that they are reporting accurate data. To date such performance monitoring has been prohibitively labor intensive and prone to human error. To address this problem we develop a classification performance monitoring system to allow operating agencies to rapidly assess the health of their classification stations on a per vehicle basis. We eliminate most of the labor demands and instead deploy a portable nonintrusive vehicle classification system (PNVCS) to classify vehicles, concurrent with an existing classification station. This article uses a LIDAR-based PNVCS but our approach is compatible with many other PNVCSs. The processing requires several intermediate steps, developed herein, including synchronizing the independent clocks and matching observations of a given vehicle between the two classification systems. The performance monitoring methodology automatically compares the vehicle classification between the existing classification station and the PNVCS for each vehicle. If the two classification systems agree, the given vehicle is automatically taken as a success. A human only looks at the vehicle when the two systems disagree, and for this task we have developed tools to semi-automate the manual validation process, greatly increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the human user. Thus, the PNVCS must be accurate enough to be used as a baseline, as verified herein. The methodology is applied to over 21,000 vehicles from several permanent and temporary vehicle classification stations to evaluate the performance of axle and length-based classification stations. The automated process does the bulk of the work, with only 8% of the vehicles requiring manual intervention. The user typically spent 3–5 seconds per vehicle reviewed, translating into only a few minutes to process the exceptions from all lanes over 1 hour of data. This approach offers a cost-effective solution to ensure that classification stations are providing accurate data, and for permanent classification stations the additional labor is a fraction of the cost to deploy the station in the first place.",vehicle classification is an important traffic parameter for transportation planning and infrastructure management vehicle classification stations depend on accurate calibration and validation to yield meaningful results operating agencies spend millions of dollars to deploy vehicle classification stations to collect classified count data yet very few of these stations are ever subjected to a rigorous performance evaluation to ensure that they are reporting accurate data to date such performance monitoring has been prohibitively labor intensive and prone to human error to address this problem we develop a classification performance monitoring system to allow operating agencies to rapidly assess the health of their classification stations on a per vehicle basis we eliminate most of the labor demands and instead deploy a portable nonintrusive vehicle classification system  to classify vehicles concurrent with an existing classification station this article uses a lidarbased pnvcs but our approach is compatible with many other pnvcss the processing requires several intermediate steps developed herein including synchronizing the independent clocks and matching observations of a given vehicle between the two classification systems the performance monitoring methodology automatically compares the vehicle classification between the existing classification station and the pnvcs for each vehicle if the two classification systems agree the given vehicle is automatically taken as a success a human only looks at the vehicle when the two systems disagree and for this task we have developed tools to semiautomate the manual validation process greatly increasing the efficiency and accuracy of the human user thus the pnvcs must be accurate enough to be used as a baseline as verified herein the methodology is applied to over  vehicles from several permanent and temporary vehicle classification stations to evaluate the performance of axle and lengthbased classification stations the automated process does the bulk of the work with only  of the vehicles requiring manual intervention the user typically spent  seconds per vehicle reviewed translating into only a few minutes to process the exceptions from all lanes over hour of data this approach offers a costeffective solution to ensure that classification stations are providing accurate data and for permanent classification stations the additional labor is a fraction of the cost to deploy the station in the first place

There are also developing countries in which taxis are not equipped with GPS devices. In such cases, a probe vehicle system has to be established by allocating probe vehicle devices to taxi dispatch centers (TDCs). In this study, the authors analyze the efficient allocation of such probe vehicle devices to TDCs under the cost constraint and the assumption of independent link travel times, adopting a definition of efficiency based on the loss to travel time information users resulting from information errors. The travel time information obtained using a probe vehicle system is the sample mean of a statistical distribution and should be treated as a statistical variable. Thus, the information error, which leads to losses to information users, is also a statistical variable. The allocation problem minimizes such losses. The results from a case study show that the loss to information users changes with the time of day and among different city areas.

Accordingly, the research presented in this article develops a simulation/optimization tool that optimizes the movement of CACC-equipped vehicles as a replacement for traditional intersection control. This system, which is named iCACC, assumes that the intersection controller receives vehicle requests to travel through an intersection and advises each vehicle on the optimum course of action ensuring no crashes occur while at the same time minimizing the intersection delay. Four intersection control scenarios are compared, namely: a traffic signal, an all-way stop control (AWSC), a roundabout, and the iCACC controller. The results show that the proposed iCACC system significantly reduces the average intersection delay and fuel consumption level by 90 and 45%, respectively.

This will drastically impact the way traffic is managed, allowing for more responsive traffic signals, better traffic information, and more accurate travel time prediction. Research suggests that to begin experiencing these benefits, at least 20% of vehicles must communicate, with benefits increasing with higher penetration rates. Because of bandwidth limitations and a possible slow deployment of the technology, only a portion of vehicles on the roadway will participate initially. Fortunately, the behavior of these communicating vehicles may be used to estimate the locations of nearby noncommunicating vehicles, thereby artificially augmenting the penetration rate and producing greater benefits. We propose an algorithm to predict the locations of individual noncommunicating vehicles based on the behaviors of nearby communicating vehicles by comparing a communicating vehicle's acceleration with its expected acceleration as predicted by a car-following model. Based on analysis from field data, the algorithm is able to predict the locations of 30% of vehicles with 9-m accuracy in the same lane, with only 10% of vehicles communicating. Similar improvements were found at other initial penetration rates of less than 80%.

The method for driving road identification is also known as map matching (MM). In spite of the development of MM algorithms, limitations still exist in obtaining the positioning data and preparing candidate roads (CRs) that may result in mismatches in some special difficult road configurations such as flyovers and parallel roads. To overcome the limitations, an integrated trajectory-based MM (tbMM) system is proposed based on the trajectory similarity evaluation method. The system can fuse the information from global positioning systems (GPS) and inertial sensors to generate the vehicle trajectory that represents the vehicle continuous movement in three dimensions. The elevation data of vehicle and roads are involved to enhance the trajectory-based matching process. Also the method employs an optimized mechanism for generating and maintaining CRs. Using the mechanism, separated road segments in a digital map are reorganized in the form of possible driving roads and the topology among them is guaranteed. Moreover, the CRs are obtained considering all the possibilities in determining the driving road so that the valuable historical information can be effectively reserved to provide more reliable matches in ambiguous situations.

Previous research involves technologies in multiple areas, and a significant number of forecasting methods exist in the literature.

Traditional travel time measurement systems such as automated number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras detect only motor vehicles and provide an estimate of their travel times. Bluetooth technology has been used as an alternative to more expensive ANPR for travel time measurements in the recent past. However, Bluetooth-sensors detect discoverable electronic devices used by all travel modes. Bluetooth-based systems currently use the time stamp of device detection events by two sensors to estimate the travel time, and there is no direct way to estimate mode-specific travel times using this approach. Hence, estimating travel time using Bluetooth technology on urban arterials without classifying the modes of detected devices could provide a biased estimate. A novel method to estimate mode-specific travel times using Bluetooth technology that is capable of estimating mode-specific travel times, specifically distinguishing between the travel time of motor vehicles and bicycles, is presented in this article. The proposed method uses information about type of detected device (class of device, CoD) and radio signal strength indication (RSSI). The proposed method also uses the travel time of the detected device and its detection pattern across the road network by multiple Bluetooth sensors to estimate the travel mode of each detected device. The accuracy of the proposed method was evaluated against the ground truth obtained by manual transcription of traffic video recordings, and was compared against travel times obtained from ANPR, a commercially deployed Bluetooth-based method, and a clustering method.

Unfortunately, their effectiveness is limited, based on the following reasons: they are costly, can only present a limited amount of information, and typically only display information in one language. The wide availability of smart devices and the development of connected vehicles offer the possibility to create “virtual” DMS (VDMS), utilizing geofencing and audible messages to convey public traffic information. This research compares the ability of VDMS to convey public traffic information with existing DMS. A mixed repeated-measure experiment using a driving simulator was designed that examined the impacts of driver age, information transmission mode, amount of information, and driving complexity on message comprehension. Forty-two participants were recruited and each of them was tested under different combinations of the three within-subject factors. Participant performance was measured in terms of message comprehension, distraction, and self-reported overall difficulty level in receiving messages. Results revealed that VDMS generally performs better than DMS as information content increases and driving condition complexity increases, regardless of driver age. VDMS increased message comprehension by 16% under relatively complex driving conditions, reduced driver reaction time to unexpected stimuli (as measured with a reduced time-to-brake of 0.39 s), and made the same messages easier to process and retain for drivers than DMS. Based on these results, it is recommended that transportation agencies give careful consideration to VDMS as a future strategy for delivering public traffic information in a connected vehicle environment.",dynamic message signs  have been widely used by transportation agencies to disseminate traffic information  for decades unfortunately their effectiveness is limited based on the following reasons they are costly can only present a limited amount of information and typically only display information in one language the wide availability of smart devices and the development of connected vehicles offer the possibility to create virtual dms  utilizing geofencing and audible messages to convey public traffic information this research compares the ability of vdms to convey public traffic information with existing dms a mixed repeatedmeasure experiment using a driving simulator was designed that examined the impacts of driver age information transmission mode amount of information and driving complexity on message comprehension fortytwo participants were recruited and each of them was tested under different combinations of the three withinsubject factors participant performance was measured in terms of message comprehension distraction and selfreported overall difficulty level in receiving messages results revealed that vdms generally performs better than dms as information content increases and driving condition complexity increases regardless of driver age vdms increased message comprehension by  under relatively complex driving conditions reduced driver reaction time to unexpected stimuli  and made the same messages easier to process and retain for drivers than dms based on these results it is recommended that transportation agencies give careful consideration to vdms as a future strategy for delivering public traffic information in a connected vehicle environment

Traffic flow is evaluated using time series, and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model has been commonly used for determining the regression-type relationship between historical and future data. However, the performance of the ARIMA model is limited by the difficulty of capturing nonlinear patterns and the challenges of diagnosing permanent white noises. Hence, a hybrid method of ARIMA-EGARCH-M-GED was developed with the intent to address those limitations. It combines the linear ARIMA model with a nonlinear model of Exponent Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (EGARCH) to capture heteroscedasticity (the variance of random error varying across the data) of traffic flow series. EGARCH in Mean (EGARCH-M), which corrects the expression of conditional variance by connecting the conditional mean directly with the variance, was introduced to better restrain the influence of abnormal data. Moreover, the tail of the generalized error distribution (GED) is better than that of the normal distribution in characterizing the features of time series, especially heteroscedasticity of residual sequences. Data collected from an interstate highway (I-80 in California) with a sampling period of 5 minutes were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The results from the hybrid model were compared with ARIMA, an artificial neural network, and a K-nearest neighbor model. The results showed that the hybrid model outperformed the other methods in terms of accuracy and reliability. Overall, the proposed model performed well in tracking the features of measured data and controlling the impact of abnormal data.",realtime traffic flow forecasting is of great importance in the development of advanced traffic management systems and advanced traveler information systems traffic flow is evaluated using time series and the autoregressive integrated moving average  model has been commonly used for determining the regressiontype relationship between historical and future data however the performance of the arima model is limited by the difficulty of capturing nonlinear patterns and the challenges of diagnosing permanent white noises hence a hybrid method of arimaegarchmged was developed with the intent to address those limitations it combines the linear arima model with a nonlinear model of exponent generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity  to capture heteroscedasticity  of traffic flow series egarch in mean  which corrects the expression of conditional variance by connecting the conditional mean directly with the variance was introduced to better restrain the influence of abnormal data moreover the tail of the generalized error distribution  is better than that of the normal distribution in characterizing the features of time series especially heteroscedasticity of residual sequences data collected from an interstate highway  with a sampling period of  minutes were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model the results from the hybrid model were compared with arima an artificial neural network and a knearest neighbor model the results showed that the hybrid model outperformed the other methods in terms of accuracy and reliability overall the proposed model performed well in tracking the features of measured data and controlling the impact of abnormal data

Particularly, in heavy traffic conditions, rear-end collisions make up the majority of traffic accidents, which make the traffic jam worse. This article proposes a novel approach to rear-end collision warning systems using areas of license plates acquired with a single camera mounted on a car. The edges of the front car's license plate are segmented and a rectangle is sketched to calculate the area, which is used for estimating distance between the cars. Relative speed of the front car is computed using the differences of the rectangles in a specific time. Distance and relative speed are obtained from the estimated areas of the license plates and transferred to the fuzzy inference system to send a warning signal to the driver for collision prevention, in emergency cases. The experiments are greatly encouraging, indicating that number plate segmentation can be utilized to estimate the distance and fuzzy inference system can be developed to create a warning signal to the drivers.",given the increase of vehicles in traffic traffic accidents have become a crucial and urgent issue for some countries particularly in heavy traffic conditions rearend collisions make up the majority of traffic accidents which make the traffic jam worse this article proposes a novel approach to rearend collision warning systems using areas of license plates acquired with a single camera mounted on a car the edges of the front cars license plate are segmented and a rectangle is sketched to calculate the area which is used for estimating distance between the cars relative speed of the front car is computed using the differences of the rectangles in a specific time distance and relative speed are obtained from the estimated areas of the license plates and transferred to the fuzzy inference system to send a warning signal to the driver for collision prevention in emergency cases the experiments are greatly encouraging indicating that number plate segmentation can be utilized to estimate the distance and fuzzy inference system can be developed to create a warning signal to the drivers

In this approach, the position of the vehicle is represented by its lateral position (the lane number) and longitudinal position (the distance from entrance of the road) in a course coordinate system along the road; the specific lane the vehicle is occupying (the lane number) can be judged using the information of lane lines detected by vision systems; then the distance to the vehicle is obtained by a Road Side Unit (RSU) during the V-I communication; and the longitudinal position is calculated. The error of the approach on typical operating conditions is analyzed, indicating that the new approach can achieve the accuracy of less than 0.31 m for straight road and 0.58 m for typical arc road with ultra-wideband communication and ranging technologies and rational arrangement of RSUs.

However, this approach appears inappropriate since travel times on successive links are essentially dependent along signalized arterials. In this study, a copula-based approach is proposed to model arterial TTD by accounting for spatial link correlations. First, TTDs on consecutive links along one arterial in Hangzhou, China are investigated. Link TTDs are estimated through the nonparametric kernel smoothing method. Link correlations are analyzed in both unfavorable and favorable coordination cases. Then, Gaussian copula models are introduced to model the dependent structure between link TTDs. The parameters of Gaussian copula are obtained by Maximum-Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Next, path TTDs covering consecutive links are estimated based on the estimated copula models. The results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed copula-based approach, compared with the convolution without capturing link correlations and the empirical distribution fitting methods in both unfavorable and favorable coordination cases.",the estimation of urban arterial travel time distribution  is critical to help implement intelligent transportation systems  and provide travelers with timely and reliable route guidance the stateofpractice procedure for arterial ttd estimation commonly assumes that the path travel time follows a certain distribution without considering link correlations however this approach appears inappropriate since travel times on successive links are essentially dependent along signalized arterials in this study a copulabased approach is proposed to model arterial ttd by accounting for spatial link correlations first ttds on consecutive links along one arterial in hangzhou china are investigated link ttds are estimated through the nonparametric kernel smoothing method link correlations are analyzed in both unfavorable and favorable coordination cases then gaussian copula models are introduced to model the dependent structure between link ttds the parameters of gaussian copula are obtained by maximumlikelihood estimation  next path ttds covering consecutive links are estimated based on the estimated copula models the results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed copulabased approach compared with the convolution without capturing link correlations and the empirical distribution fitting methods in both unfavorable and favorable coordination cases

On the other hand, not all compartments of the flow signal are of same importance in determining its future state. A model is developed to predict the value of traffic flow in near future (next 5–35 minutes) based on the combination of wavelet transformation and artificial neural networks. This model is called the hybrid WT-ANN. Wavelet transformation is set to denoise the flow signal, i.e., filtering the unimportant fluctuations of the flow signal. Unimportant fluctuations are those that have little or no effect on the future condition of the signal. The neural network is set and trained to use previous data for predicting future flow. To implement the system, traffic data of US-101 were used from Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM). Results show that removing the noises has improved the accuracy of the prediction to a great extent. The model was used to predict the flow in three different locations on the same highway and a different highway in a different country. The model rendered highly reliable predictions.

It has a great influence on driving safety and fuel consumption. One of the challenges in this regard is the modeling perspective to treat with uncertainty in judgments about driving behaviors. Really, assessing a single maneuver with a rigid threshold leads to a weak judgment for driving evaluation. To fill this gap, a novel neuro-fuzzy system is proposed to classify the driving behaviors based on their similarities to fuzzy patterns when all of the various maneuvers are stated with some fuzzy numbers. These patterns are also fuzzy numbers and they are extracted from statistical analysis on the smartphone sensors data. Our driving evaluation system consists of three processes. Firstly, it detects the type of all of the maneuvers through the driving period, by using a multi-layer perceptron neural network. Secondly, it extracts a new feature based on the acceleration and assigns three fuzzy numbers to driver’s lane change, turn and U-turn maneuvers. Thirdly, it determines the similarity between these three fuzzy numbers and the fuzzy patterns to evaluate the safe and the aggressive driving scores. To validate this model, Driver’s Angry Score (DAS) questionnaires are used.

Second, a comparison was made with Wavetronix smart sensors, commonly used sensors in traffic management, to explore INRIX’s speed data quality. A statistical analysis on the behavior of INRIX speed bias, identified some of the influential factors in defining the magnitude of speed bias.

The accurate RLR prediction can effectively reduce crashes caused by RLR behavior. The RLR prediction is usually composed of two parts: the vehicle’s stop-or-go behavior and the arrival time when the vehicle reaches the stop line. Previous stop-or-go prediction models are usually based on embedded traffic sensors using machine learning algorithms. While based on the continuous trajectories collected by radar sensors, RLR prediction can be conducted more effectively. In this paper, a probabilistic stop-or-go prediction model based on the Bayesian network (BN) is proposed for RLR prediction. We extend the deterministic output into the probabilistic output, which provides decision-makers with greater autonomy. The causality of BN improves the interpretability of the prediction model. The BN model is calibrated and tested by the continuous trajectories data measured by radar sensors installed at a signalized intersection. We not only consider the movement measurements of individual vehicles (e.g., speed and acceleration), but also take into account the car-following behavior. As a comparison, different machine learning models and the model based on the inductive loop detection (ILD) are adopted.

In this research, we use high-resolution vehicle trajectory data collected via a smartphone app, which is capable of keeping track of individual driver’s behavior before and after road capacity reduction, to investigate travelers’ behavioral responses to pre-planned events and the contribution factors.

It is shown that some changes are required in the design of a transit route network, and in the timetabling and vehicle scheduling processes. Other changes are not required, but are advisable, using this opportunity upon the introduction of EB. The work covers the main characteristics of different types of EB with a short description, including the most popular charging technologies, and it presents the generally accepted transit operations planning process. Likewise, it describes and analytically formulates new challenges that arise when introducing EB. The outcome of the analyses shows that multiple new considerations must take place. It is also shown that the different charging techniques will influence the operations planning process in different ways and to a varying extent. With overnight, quick and continuous charging, the main challenges are in the network route design step, given the possibility of altering the existing network of routes, with efficient and optimal changes of the timetabling and vehicle scheduling components. An illustrative example, based on four bus lines in Norrköping, Sweden, is formulized and introduced using three problem instances of 48, 82, and 116 bus trips.

Railway timetable optimization is dealt with maximizing the number of synchronized meetings to allow for smooth transfers at interchanges. The developed model uses binary variables to record the number of synchronized meetings considering the importance of transfer stations and rail lines without the need to apply the modeling of passenger assignments. The model allows for a permissible and flexible transfer waiting time for making a connection between rails instead of the commonly used and assumed values. The solution of the mixed-integer programing problem of larger-sized railway networks is based on a synchronized and coordinated scheduling optimization genetic algorithm (SCSO-GA) with a local search strategy (LSS). This solution method is proved to be more efficient and accurate than the CPLEX solver. In addition it is proven to be a periodic event-scheduling problem (PESP) solver.

As recommended in railway standards, the design process of each system, here the autonomous localization units (LU), follows the V-model whose first step is to define its availability requirement in order to satisfy the global ETCS system requirements. The classical approach for assigning the subsystem availability is based on the assumption that failure parameters of other units are precisely known. This assumption is too restricted in reality due to the lack of information. In this paper, we propose a new approach that allows taking into account uncertainties in the dependability parameters of the ETCS components for identifying the upper threshold of the LU unavailability to reach ETCS availability requirements.

To recommend a customized path depending on the trip purpose and the driver’s risk-taking behavior, various path ranking methods have been developed. Unlike those methods, our proposed disutility method can easily incorporate a target arrival time in the ranking process by measuring how late the travel is and by penalizing it depending on the severity of lateness. In addition, the disutility-based route guidance system can properly address travel time unreliability that causes unacceptable disruptions to the driver’s schedule (i.e., unexpected long delay). We compare the disutility-based path ranking method with other ranking methods, the percentile travel time, the mean excess travel time, and the on-time arrival probability. We show that the disutility has stronger discriminating power and requires less solution space to find an optimal path. The most important advantage is that it can estimate a driver’s risk-taking behavior for each trip purpose by using the discrete choice analysis. We construct a simulation framework to acquire the travel time data on a hypothetical roadway. We analyze the data and show how various ranking methods recommend a customized path.

Closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras enable station managers to monitor the crowd and reduce overcrowding risks. However, identifying congestion conditions is a very laborious task for a human operator who has to monitor multiple locations at the same time. This paper presents a new approach to automated image-based identification of congestion as measured by level of service (LOS), which is the most widely accepted standard for measuring congestion. Existing methods for measuring LOS based on crowd density estimation from images have the disadvantages that, crowd density cannot be estimated accurately. In addition, the calculation of flow parameters involves a complex process, and consequently these parameters are not indicative of congestion in real-time. This paper proposes a novel method based on machine learning to directly classify LOS without calculating flow parameters. In the proposed method, visual features extracted by a deep convolutional neural network are classified using a support vector machine classifier and the classification results are further refined by using a long short-term memory network. A second contribution of this research is to develop a web-based LOS map visualization platform to monitor pedestrian distribution and variation of distribution in real-time.

Bus operations are usually affected by increasing differences in the time intervals (headways) between consecutive buses. The effect of this variability is that buses tend to group into bunches of two or more, which severely affects the quality of service and the operational efficiency. The aim of this paper is to analyze which factors are associated to the phenomenon, using massive data from high-frequency services available in Santiago (Chile) and common-route services in Gatineau (Canada). The data is obtained from the bus GPS and AFC systems and are processed to obtain headways between buses. Using data from one week, we develop models to explain the variation of the continuous and discrete indicators of bus bunching as a function of variables related to the operation, variables related to the demand structure, and variables related to the infrastructure. Some of the factors that contribute to increase bus bunching are: stops located toward the end of the route, high scheduled frequency, irregular bus dispatch headways, non-homogeneous fleet, high demand, and high variability of demand. The results are useful for the design of quality indexes to measure bunching in bus operations, and for the design and operation of bus routes, taking into consideration the potential bus bunching problems.",bus bunching is a wellknown phenomenon for operators users and regulators of highfrequency bus services bus operations are usually affected by increasing differences in the time intervals  between consecutive buses the effect of this variability is that buses tend to group into bunches of two or more which severely affects the quality of service and the operational efficiency the aim of this paper is to analyze which factors are associated to the phenomenon using massive data from highfrequency services available in santiago  and commonroute services in gatineau  the data is obtained from the bus gps and afc systems and are processed to obtain headways between buses using data from one week we develop models to explain the variation of the continuous and discrete indicators of bus bunching as a function of variables related to the operation variables related to the demand structure and variables related to the infrastructure some of the factors that contribute to increase bus bunching are stops located toward the end of the route high scheduled frequency irregular bus dispatch headways nonhomogeneous fleet high demand and high variability of demand the results are useful for the design of quality indexes to measure bunching in bus operations and for the design and operation of bus routes taking into consideration the potential bus bunching problems

By using speed regulation of two vehicles approaching an intersection on crossroads, ITEMS is able to resolve intersection conflicts. This obviates the need for either vehicle to stop. Two-vehicle and four-vehicle scenarios were simulated. It was found that ITEMS reduced the total energy about 22% and the trip time across the intersection by almost 16% for every scenario compared to a traditional fixed-timed traffic light intersection.

There are several location models that have been developed recently for vehicle identification (ID) sensors. However, these location models cannot be applied to large networks because there are many constraints and integer variables. Based on a property of the location problem for vehicle ID sensors, given the initial vehicle ID sensors that are pre-installed and fixed on the network, this article presents a solution that greatly reduces the size of this location problem. An applied example demonstrates that when 8% of the arcs from a real network that are randomly selected have a vehicle ID sensor, the reductions are as large as 97% for the number of remaining constraints in the location model and 84% for the adjusted diameter of the feasible region of target flow. Using these two indices as target functions, two greedy algorithms are presented for solving the vehicle ID sensor location problem. These two algorithms were applied to an example in Mashhad city with 2,526 arcs, 7,157 origin-destination pairs and 121,627 paths. Using these algorithms, installing vehicle ID sensors on 8% of the network arcs results in satisfaction of 99.82% of the constraints in the location model and 97.6% reduction in the adjusted maximum possible error index.

In this study, three indicators are constructed using the Shanghai taxi global positioning system (GPS) dataset to reveal the spatial–temporal mismatch pattern. The issue is further analyzed via a case study, in which seven regions with frequent mismatch patterns are identified in the time period from 21:00 to 22:00.

Most previous traffic sub-region division methods of static characteristics are not suitable for dynamic traffic management. This article proposes the division model of traffic sub-regions and identification method of critical control areas based on macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) theory closely integrated with dynamic characteristics of road network traffic. To be specific, the existence of small-scale road network MFD is confirmed at first through the traffic data transmitted from Jiangbei district in Chongqing, China. The initial control sub-regions of the road network are formulated with each small-scale road network as a control area. Then, the traffic state value of sub-regions is calculated by means of regression analysis. A set of rules are designed to aggregate the initial sub-regions, which are associated with the traffic state and geographically adjacent, and the adjusted traffic sub-regions are obtained by means of correlation coefficient analysis. Finally, the identification method of traffic critical control sub-regions is proposed based on clustering analysis. In addition, the identification model of critical control sub-regions is applied and analyzed in the experimental road network of Jiangbei district in Chongqing, China. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is flexible and efficient enough to improve the control over road networks, promoting application of traffic sub-region division based on MFD in dynamic traffic control over actual road networks.",as traffic congestion intensifies identification and control of critical areas to balance road network traffic flow are of paramount importance to mitigate and prevent traffic congestion based on the road network traffic realities most previous traffic subregion division methods of static characteristics are not suitable for dynamic traffic management this article proposes the division model of traffic subregions and identification method of critical control areas based on macroscopic fundamental diagram  theory closely integrated with dynamic characteristics of road network traffic to be specific the existence of smallscale road network mfd is confirmed at first through the traffic data transmitted from jiangbei district in chongqing china the initial control subregions of the road network are formulated with each smallscale road network as a control area then the traffic state value of subregions is calculated by means of regression analysis a set of rules are designed to aggregate the initial subregions which are associated with the traffic state and geographically adjacent and the adjusted traffic subregions are obtained by means of correlation coefficient analysis finally the identification method of traffic critical control subregions is proposed based on clustering analysis in addition the identification model of critical control subregions is applied and analyzed in the experimental road network of jiangbei district in chongqing china the results demonstrate that the proposed model is flexible and efficient enough to improve the control over road networks promoting application of traffic subregion division based on mfd in dynamic traffic control over actual road networks

Travelers often spend a sizable amount of time searching for available parking spaces. This increases travelers’ overall travel cost and causes additional congestion on the road. Without a good parking information guidance system, parking search remains a trial and error process. In this article, we propose a dynamic parking guidance system that integrates parking destination switching and real-time traffic routing. Drivers can switch their parking destinations and routes during their trip to minimize their expected travel costs. The probability that a driver is willing to switch to a new parking garage is taken to be proportional to the cost difference of the current parking destination and the new one. Microscopic simulation using SUMO and OmNet++ is designed to test the proposed dynamic parking and route guidance system. The simulation results show that with the proposed joint dynamic parking destination switching and dynamic traffic routing, the average overall cost in the network can be reduced.

In order for a CAV to operate safely, it needs information such as static data (high-resolution navigation maps) and real-time dynamics from various sensors, some of which exchange information with other vehicles or roadside units. High resolution navigation maps can integrate historical on-road driving performance data to help CAVs and drivers operating vehicles with low level automation make informed proactive decisions. This study proposes that navigation maps on CAVs come pre-installed with historical driving data and that they work together with real-time sensors to help CAVs plan maneuvers. Historical driving data offers insights about decisions made by drivers at locations along a route, e.g., where drivers often make sharp turns or where they accelerate and decelerate hard. A pre-installed record of historical driving decisions will support informed decision-making and proactively “warn” CAVs and drivers about potential hazards. This study explores location-based driving volatility as a key to improving safety through CAVs. Location-based volatility is a measure of historical driving performance, defined as the percentage of extreme maneuvers performed on a location in road network. For demonstration, we modeled and visualized real-world high-resolution geo-referenced data. The data comes from a connected vehicle safety pilot program in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

WWD countermeasures equipped with Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies, such as warning lights and detection devices, have been proven to reduce WWD. However, agencies often cannot deploy these ITS countermeasures at all exit ramps due to their expense. This paper discusses an innovative WWD countermeasure optimization approach to help agencies identify the optimal deployment locations based on available resources. The approach consists of a WWD crash risk (WWCR) model and a WWD countermeasures optimization algorithm. The WWCR model uses non-crash WWD events, interchange designs, and traffic volumes to predict the number of WWD crashes on multi-exit segments of limited access facilities. Then, the optimization algorithm uses the model results to identify the best exits for ITS countermeasure deployment based on WWCR reduction, available resources, and other applicable constraints. This approach was applied to the Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise (FTE) toll road network. Twenty-four segments were identified as WWD hotspots due to high WWCR. Three different optimization scenarios were tested to show how different constraints affect the results. These scenarios resulted in 38% to 41% of the maximum possible WWCR reduction by equipping only 39 of the 196 FTE ramps (20%) and could help FTE better utilize its investment by 36% compared to only equipping ramps in the identified 24 WWD hotspots.

In this case of application, estimated parameter is the maximum friction coefficient. Additionally, proposed methodology is tested experimentally by using the measurements taken from a tram wheel test stand. Multiple mathematical models of the test stand are created with different maximum friction coefficients, whereas all initial conditions and other system parameters are same for each model. Therefore, comparison of the output of each model with measurements is considered to interpret the parameter value of the model, which best represents the system, is selected as parameter estimate.

Unfortunately, the low spatial resolution of weight sensors along the transportation network can limit these and other potential applications. The main contribution of this paper is a methodology to estimate gross vehicle weight (GVW) distributions at traffic count sites, which collect traffic volumes but currently do not have the ability to directly measure vehicle weight. This paper presents a method for estimating GVW distributions of five-axle tractor-trailers (“3-S2”) at traffic count sites by fuzing weight data from weigh-in-motion (WIM) sites with position data from global positioning system (GPS) equipped trucks. Truck travel patterns derived from a truck GPS database were used to determine the degree to which a WIM and traffic count site are spatially related. A GVW distribution was then estimated by combining Gaussian mixture models (GMM) estimated at WIM sites defined to be spatially related to the traffic count site.

And also these images from cameras across a large number of highway sites could show a very rich variance of scenes, road configurations. We are very interested to study whether convolutional networks are still reliably able to classify such images, without any special previous processing such as segmentation of objective roads.

We build a highway imagery dataset using real-life traffic videos to evaluate the CNNs recognition performance. These images cover a wide range of road configurations, times of the day, weather and lighting conditions, and have been labeled with one of the two states, congestion or non-congestion.

This paper compares the safety performance of two types of ITS WWD countermeasures implemented in Florida: Light-Emitting Diode (LED) signs in South Florida (which include one set of signs and one camera) and Rectangular Flashing Beacon (RFB) signs in Central Florida (which include two sets of signs and three cameras). The reduction in WWD events (911 calls and citations) and the percentage of wrong-way drivers who self-corrected their WWD behavior were used as surrogate safety performance measures instead of crashes, since WWD crashes are rare. Chi-squared tests revealed a significant reduction in WWD events at the LED and RFB treated sites compared to control sites without these countermeasures. Comparison group analyses indicated that the LED and RFB countermeasures reduced WWD events by 48.1% and 69.4%, respectively. Additionally, photographs taken by cameras on the countermeasures and/or closed-circuit television cameras monitored by the traffic management centers showed that over 16% of the 72 detected wrong-way vehicles self-corrected at the LED sites and 81% of the 353 detected wrong-way vehicles self-corrected at the RFB sites.
